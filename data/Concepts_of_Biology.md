**INTRODUCTION**

The elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus are

the key building blocks of the chemicals found in living things. They form the carbohydrates,
nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids (all of which will be defined later in this chapter) that are the
fundamental molecular components of all organisms. In this chapter, we will discuss these
important building blocks and learn how the unique properties of the atoms of different elements
affect their interactions with other atoms to form the molecules of life.

Food provides an organism with nutrients—the matter it needs to survive. Many of these critical
nutrients come in the form of biological macromolecules, or large molecules necessary for life.
These macromolecules are built from different combinations of smaller organic molecules. What
specific types of biological macromolecules do living things require? How are these molecules
formed? What functions do they serve? In this chapter, we will explore these questions.

### 2.1 The Building Blocks of Molecules

**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Describe matter and elements

- Describe the interrelationship between protons, neutrons, and electrons, and the ways in
which electrons can be donated or shared between atoms

At its most fundamental level, life is made up of matter. **Matter** occupies space and has mass. All
matter is composed of **elements** , substances that cannot be broken down or transformed
chemically into other substances. Each element is made of atoms, each with a constant number of
protons and unique properties. A total of 118 elements have been defined; however, only 92 occur
naturally, and fewer than 30 are found in living cells. The remaining 26 elements are unstable and,
therefore, do not exist for very long or are theoretical and have yet to be detected.

Each element is designated by its chemical symbol (such as H, N, O, C, and Na), and possesses
unique properties. These unique properties allow elements to combine and to bond with each
other in specific ways.

#### Atoms

An atom is the smallest component of an element that retains all of the chemical properties of
that element. For example, one hydrogen atom has all of the properties of the element hydrogen,
such as it exists as a gas at room temperature, and it bonds with oxygen to create a water
molecule. Hydrogen atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the
properties of hydrogen. If a hydrogen atom were broken down into subatomic particles, it would
no longer have the properties of hydrogen.

At the most basic level, all organisms are made of a combination of elements. They contain atoms
that combine together to form molecules. In multicellular organisms, such as animals, molecules
can interact to form cells that combine to form tissues, which make up organs. These
combinations continue until entire multicellular organisms are formed.

All atoms contain protons, electrons, and neutrons ( Figure 2.2 ). The most common isotope of
hydrogen (H) is the only exception and is made of one proton and one electron with no neutrons. A
**proton** is a positively charged particle that resides in the **nucleus** (the core of the atom) of an atom
and has a mass of 1 and a charge of +1. An **electron** is a negatively charged particle that travels in
the space around the nucleus. In other words, it resides outside of the nucleus. It has a negligible
mass and has a charge of –1.

**FIGURE 2.2** Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the nucleus, and electrons surrounding the
nucleus.

**Neutrons** , like protons, reside in the nucleus of an atom. They have a mass of 1 and no charge.
The positive (protons) and negative (electrons) charges balance each other in a neutral atom,
which has a net zero charge.

**2.1 - The Building Blocks of Molecules** **29**

Because protons and neutrons each have a mass of 1, the mass of an atom is equal to the number of protons and
neutrons of that atom. The number of electrons does not factor into the overall mass, because their mass is so
small.

As stated earlier, each element has its own unique properties. Each contains a different number of protons and
neutrons, giving it its own atomic number and mass number. The **atomic number** of an element is equal to the
number of protons that element contains. The **mass number** , or atomic mass, is the number of protons plus the
number of neutrons of that element. Therefore, it is possible to determine the number of neutrons by subtracting
the atomic number from the mass number.

These numbers provide information about the elements and how they will react when combined. Different elements
have different melting and boiling points, and are in different states (liquid, solid, or gas) at room temperature. They
also combine in different ways. Some form specific types of bonds, whereas others do not. How they combine is
based on the number of electrons present. Because of these characteristics, the elements are arranged into the
**periodic table of elements** , a chart of the elements that includes the atomic number and relative atomic mass of
each element. The periodic table also provides key information about the properties of elements ( Figure 2.2 )—often
indicated by color-coding. The arrangement of the table also shows how the electrons in each element are
organized and provides important details about how atoms will react with each other to form molecules.

**Isotopes** are different forms of the same element that have the same number of protons, but a different number of
neutrons. Some elements, such as carbon, potassium, and uranium, have naturally occurring isotopes. Carbon-12,
the most common isotope of carbon, contains six protons and six neutrons. Therefore, it has a mass number of 12
(six protons and six neutrons) and an atomic number of 6 (which makes it carbon). Carbon-14 contains six protons
and eight neutrons. Therefore, it has a mass number of 14 (six protons and eight neutrons) and an atomic number of
6, meaning it is still the element carbon. These two alternate forms of carbon are isotopes. Some isotopes are
unstable and will lose protons, other subatomic particles, or energy to form more stable elements. These are called
**radioactive isotopes** or radioisotopes.

#### VISUAL CONNECTION

**FIGURE 2.3** Arranged in columns and rows based on the characteristics of the elements, the periodic table provides key information about
the elements and how they might interact with each other to form molecules. Most periodic tables provide a key or legend to the
information they contain.

How many neutrons do (K) potassium-39 and potassium-40 have, respectively?

#### EVOLUTION CONNECTION

#### Carbon Dating
Carbon-14 ( 14 C) is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. This is a
continuous process, so more  14 C is always being created. As a living organism develops, the relative level of  14 C in
its body is equal to the concentration of  14 C in the atmosphere. When an organism dies, it is no longer ingesting  14 C,
so the ratio will decline.  14 C decays to  14 N by a process called beta decay; it gives off energy in this slow process.

After approximately 5,730 years, only one-half of the starting concentration of  14 C will have been converted to  14 N.
The time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay to its more stable form is called its half-
life. Because the half-life of  14 C is long, it is used to age formerly living objects, such as fossils. Using the ratio of the
14 C concentration found in an object to the amount of 14 C detected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope
that has not yet decayed can be determined. Based on this amount, the age of the fossil can be calculated to about
50,000 years ( Figure 2.4 ). Isotopes with longer half-lives, such as potassium-40, are used to calculate the ages of
older fossils. Through the use of carbon dating, scientists can reconstruct the ecology and biogeography of
organisms living within the past 50,000 years.

#### Chemical Bonds

How elements interact with one another depends on how their electrons are arranged and how many openings for
electrons exist at the outermost region where electrons are present in an atom. Electrons exist at energy levels that
form shells around the nucleus. The closest shell can hold up to two electrons. The closest shell to the nucleus is
always filled first, before any other shell can be filled. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it has only one spot
occupied within the lowest shell. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely fill the lowest shell with its
two electrons. If you look at the periodic table, you will see that hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in
the first row. This is because they only have electrons in their first shell. Hydrogen and helium are the only two
elements that have the lowest shell and no other shells.

The second and third energy levels can hold up to eight electrons. The eight electrons are arranged in four pairs and
one position in each pair is filled with an electron before any pairs are completed.

Looking at the periodic table again ( Figure 2.3 ), you will notice that there are seven rows. These rows correspond to
the number of shells that the elements within that row have. The elements within a particular row have increasing
numbers of electrons as the columns proceed from left to right. Although each element has the same number of
shells, not all of the shells are completely filled with electrons. If you look at the second row of the periodic table,
you will find lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and neon (Ne).
These all have electrons that occupy only the first and second shells. Lithium has only one electron in its outermost
shell, beryllium has two electrons, boron has three, and so on, until the entire shell is filled with eight electrons, as is
the case with neon.

Not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells, but an atom is at its most stable when all of the
electron positions in the outermost shell are filled. Because of these vacancies in the outermost shells, we see the
formation of **chemical bonds** , or interactions between two or more of the same or different elements that result in
the formation of molecules. To achieve greater stability, atoms will tend to completely fill their outer shells and will
bond with other elements to accomplish this goal by sharing electrons, accepting electrons from another atom, or
donating electrons to another atom. Because the outermost shells of the elements with low atomic numbers (up to



-----


**32** **2 - Chemistry of Life**

calcium, with atomic number 20) can hold eight electrons, this is referred to as the **octet rule** . An element can
donate, accept, or share electrons with other elements to fill its outer shell and satisfy the octet rule.

When an atom does not contain equal numbers of protons and electrons, it is called an **ion** . Because the number of
electrons does not equal the number of protons, each ion has a net charge. Positive ions are formed by losing
electrons and are called **cations** . Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called **anions** .

For example, sodium only has one electron in its outermost shell. It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one
electron than it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11
protons and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. It is now called a sodium ion.

The chlorine atom has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one
electron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons and 18 electrons,
giving it a net negative (–1) charge. It is now called a chloride ion. This movement of electrons from one element to
another is referred to as **electron transfer** . As Figure 2.5 illustrates, a sodium atom (Na) only has one electron in its
outermost shell, whereas a chlorine atom (Cl) has seven electrons in its outermost shell. A sodium atom will donate
its one electron to empty its shell, and a chlorine atom will accept that electron to fill its shell, becoming chloride.
Both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no
longer equal to the number of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium) or –1 (chloride) charge.

**FIGURE 2.5** Elements tend to fill their outermost shells with electrons. To do this, they can either donate or accept electrons from other
elements.

**Ionic Bonds**
There are four types of bonds or interactions: ionic, covalent, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals interactions. Ionic
and covalent bonds are strong interactions that require a larger energy input to break apart. When an element
donates an electron from its outer shell, as in the sodium atom example above, a positive ion is formed. The
element accepting the electron is now negatively charged. Because positive and negative charges attract, these ions
stay together and form an **ionic bond** , or a bond between ions. The elements bond together with the electron from
one element staying predominantly with the other element. When Na +  and Cl –  ions combine to produce NaCl, an
electron from a sodium atom stays with the other seven from the chlorine atom, and the sodium and chloride ions
attract each other in a lattice of ions with a net zero charge.

**Covalent Bonds**
Another type of strong chemical bond between two or more atoms is a **covalent bond** . These bonds form when an
electron is shared between two elements and are the strongest and most common form of chemical bond in living
organisms. Covalent bonds form between the elements that make up the biological molecules in our cells. Unlike

**2.1 - The Building Blocks of Molecules** **33**

ionic bonds, covalent bonds do not dissociate in water.

The hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine to form water molecules are bound together by covalent bonds. The
electron from the hydrogen atom divides its time between the outer shell of the hydrogen atom and the incomplete
outer shell of the oxygen atom. To completely fill the outer shell of an oxygen atom, two electrons from two
hydrogen atoms are needed, hence the subscript “2” in H 2 O. The electrons are shared between the atoms, dividing
their time between them to “fill” the outer shell of each. This sharing is a lower energy state for all of the atoms
involved than if they existed without their outer shells filled.

There are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar. **Nonpolar covalent bonds** form between two atoms of
the same element or between different elements that share the electrons equally. For example, an oxygen atom can
bond with another oxygen atom to fill their outer shells. This association is nonpolar because the electrons will be
equally distributed between each oxygen atom. Two covalent bonds form between the two oxygen atoms because
oxygen requires two shared electrons to fill its outermost shell. Nitrogen atoms will form three covalent bonds (also
called triple covalent) between two atoms of nitrogen because each nitrogen atom needs three electrons to fill its
outermost shell. Another example of a nonpolar covalent bond is found in the methane (CH 4 ) molecule. The carbon
atom has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs four more to fill it. It gets these four from four hydrogen
atoms, each atom providing one. These elements all share the electrons equally, creating four nonpolar covalent
bonds ( Figure 2.6 ).

In a **polar covalent bond** , the electrons shared by the atoms spend more time closer to one nucleus than to the
other nucleus. Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the different nuclei, a slightly positive (δ+)
or slightly negative (δ–) charge develops. The covalent bonds between hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are
polar covalent bonds. The shared electrons spend more time near the oxygen nucleus, giving it a small negative
charge, than they spend near the hydrogen nuclei, giving these molecules a small positive charge.

**FIGURE 2.6** The water molecule (left) depicts a polar bond with a slightly positive charge on the hydrogen atoms and a slightly negative
charge on the oxygen. Examples of nonpolar bonds include methane (middle) and oxygen (right).

**Hydrogen Bonds**
Ionic and covalent bonds are strong bonds that require considerable energy to break. However, not all bonds
between elements are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can also form. These are attractions that occur
between positive and negative charges that do not require much energy to break. Two weak bonds that occur
frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. These bonds give rise to the unique properties of
water and the unique structures of DNA and proteins.

When polar covalent bonds containing a hydrogen atom form, the hydrogen atom in that bond has a slightly positive
charge. This is because the shared electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the
hydrogen nucleus. Because the hydrogen atom is slightly positive (δ+), it will be attracted to neighboring negative
partial charges (δ–). When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the δ+ charge of the hydrogen atom of
one molecule and the δ– charge of the other molecule. This interaction is called a **hydrogen bond** . This type of bond
is common; for example, the liquid nature of water is caused by the hydrogen bonds between water molecules
( Figure 2.7 ). Hydrogen bonds give water the unique properties that sustain life. If it were not for hydrogen bonding,

**34** **2 - Chemistry of Life**

water would be a gas rather than a liquid at room temperature.

**FIGURE 2.7** Hydrogen bonds form between slightly positive (δ+) and slightly negative (δ–) charges of polar covalent molecules, such as
water.

Hydrogen bonds can form between different molecules and they do not always have to include a water molecule.
Hydrogen atoms in polar bonds within any molecule can form bonds with other adjacent molecules. For example,
hydrogen bonds hold together two long strands of DNA to give the DNA molecule its characteristic double-stranded
structure. Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for some of the three-dimensional structure of proteins.

**van der Waals Interactions**
Like hydrogen bonds, **van der Waals interactions** are weak attractions or interactions between molecules. They
occur between polar, covalently bound, atoms in different molecules. Some of these weak attractions are caused by
temporary partial charges formed when electrons move around a nucleus. These weak interactions between
molecules are important in biological systems.

#### Radiography Technician
Have you or anyone you know ever had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, a mammogram, or an X-ray?
These tests produce images of your soft tissues and organs (as with an MRI or mammogram) or your bones (as
happens in an X-ray) by using either radiowaves or special isotopes (radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled) that are
ingested or injected into the body. These tests provide data for disease diagnoses by creating images of your organs
or skeletal system.

MRI imaging works by subjecting hydrogen nuclei, which are abundant in the water in soft tissues, to fluctuating
magnetic fields, which cause them to emit their own magnetic field. This signal is then read by sensors in the
machine and interpreted by a computer to form a detailed image.

Some radiography technologists and technicians specialize in computed tomography, MRI, and mammography. They
produce films or images of the body that help medical professionals examine and diagnose. Radiologists work
directly with patients, explaining machinery, preparing them for exams, and ensuring that their body or body parts
are positioned correctly to produce the needed images. Physicians or radiologists then analyze the test results.

Radiography technicians can work in hospitals, doctors’ offices, or specialized imaging centers. Training to become a
radiography technician happens at hospitals, colleges, and universities that offer certificates, associate’s degrees, or
bachelor’s degrees in radiography.

### 2.2 Water

**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Describe the properties of water that are critical to maintaining life

Do you ever wonder why scientists spend time looking for water on other planets? It is because water is essential to
life; even minute traces of it on another planet can indicate that life could or did exist on that planet. Water is one of

**2.2 - Water** **35**

the more abundant molecules in living cells and the one most critical to life as we know it. Approximately 60–70
percent of your body is made up of water. Without it, life simply would not exist.

#### Water Is Polar

The hydrogen and oxygen atoms within water molecules form polar covalent bonds. The shared electrons spend
more time associated with the oxygen atom than they do with hydrogen atoms. There is no overall charge to a water
molecule, but there is a slight positive charge on each hydrogen atom and a slight negative charge on the oxygen
atom. Because of these charges, the slightly positive hydrogen atoms repel each other and form the unique shape
seen in Figure 2.7 . Each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the positive and negative
charges in the different parts of the molecule. Water also attracts other polar molecules (such as sugars), forming
hydrogen bonds. When a substance readily forms hydrogen bonds with water, it can dissolve in water and is referred
to as **hydrophilic** (“water-loving”). Hydrogen bonds are not readily formed with nonpolar substances like oils and
fats ( Figure 2.8 ). These nonpolar compounds are **hydrophobic** (“water-fearing”) and will not dissolve in water.

**FIGURE 2.8** As this macroscopic image of oil and water show, oil is a nonpolar compound and, hence, will not dissolve in water. Oil and
water do not mix. (credit: Gautam Dogra)

#### Water Stabilizes Temperature

The hydrogen bonds in water allow it to absorb and release heat energy more slowly than many other substances.
**Temperature** is a measure of the motion (kinetic energy) of molecules. As the motion increases, energy is higher
and thus temperature is higher. Water absorbs a great deal of energy before its temperature rises. Increased energy
disrupts the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Because these bonds can be created and disrupted rapidly,
water absorbs an increase in energy and temperature changes only minimally. This means that water moderates
temperature changes within organisms and in their environments. As energy input continues, the balance between
hydrogen-bond formation and destruction swings toward the destruction side. More bonds are broken than are
formed. This process results in the release of individual water molecules at the surface of the liquid (such as a body
of water, the leaves of a plant, or the skin of an organism) in a process called **evaporation** . Evaporation of sweat,
which is 90 percent water, allows for cooling of an organism, because breaking hydrogen bonds requires an input of
energy and takes heat away from the body.

Conversely, as molecular motion decreases and temperatures drop, less energy is present to break the hydrogen
bonds between water molecules. These bonds remain intact and begin to form a rigid, lattice-like structure (e.g.,
ice) ( Figure 2.9 **a** ). When frozen, ice is less dense than liquid water (the molecules are farther apart). This means that
ice floats on the surface of a body of water ( Figure 2.9 **b** ). In lakes, ponds, and oceans, ice will form on the surface of
the water, creating an insulating barrier to protect the animal and plant life beneath from freezing in the water. If this
did not happen, plants and animals living in water would freeze in a block of ice and could not move freely, making
life in cold temperatures difficult or impossible.

#### Water Is an Excellent Solvent

Because water is polar, with slight positive and negative charges, ionic compounds and polar molecules can readily
dissolve in it. Water is, therefore, what is referred to as a **solvent** —a substance capable of dissolving another
substance. The charged particles will form hydrogen bonds with a surrounding layer of water molecules. This is
referred to as a sphere of hydration and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water. In the case
of table salt (NaCl) mixed in water ( Figure 2.10 ), the sodium and chloride ions separate, or dissociate, in the water,
and spheres of hydration are formed around the ions. A positively charged sodium ion is surrounded by the partially
negative charges of oxygen atoms in water molecules. A negatively charged chloride ion is surrounded by the
partially positive charges of hydrogen atoms in water molecules. These spheres of hydration are also referred to as
hydration shells. The polarity of the water molecule makes it an effective solvent and is important in its many roles
in living systems.

**FIGURE 2.10** When table salt (NaCl) is mixed in water, spheres of hydration form around the ions.

**2.2 - Water** **37**

#### Water Is Cohesive

Have you ever filled up a glass of water to the very top and then slowly added a few more drops? Before it overflows,
the water actually forms a dome-like shape above the rim of the glass. This water can stay above the glass because
of the property of **cohesion** . In cohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen
bonding), keeping the molecules together at the liquid-air (gas) interface, although there is no more room in the
glass. Cohesion gives rise to **surface tension** , the capacity of a substance to withstand rupture when placed under
tension or stress. When you drop a small scrap of paper onto a droplet of water, the paper floats on top of the water
droplet, although the object is denser (heavier) than the water. This occurs because of the surface tension that is
created by the water molecules. Cohesion and surface tension keep the water molecules intact and the item floating
on the top. It is even possible to “float” a steel needle on top of a glass of water if you place it gently, without
breaking the surface tension ( Figure 2.11 ).

**FIGURE 2.11** The weight of a needle on top of water pulls the surface tension downward; at the same time, the surface tension of the water
is pulling it up, suspending the needle on the surface of the water and keeping it from sinking. Notice the indentation in the water around
the needle. (credit: Cory Zanker)

These cohesive forces are also related to the water’s property of **adhesion** , or the attraction between water
molecules and other molecules. This is observed when water “climbs” up a straw placed in a glass of water. You will
notice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the straw than in the middle. This is because the water
molecules are attracted to the straw and therefore adhere to it.

Cohesive and adhesive forces are important for sustaining life. For example, because of these forces, water can flow
up from the roots to the tops of plants to feed the plant.

#### Buffers, pH, Acids, and Bases

The pH of a solution is a measure of its acidity or bascicity. You have probably used **litmus paper** , paper that has
been treated with a natural water-soluble dye so it can be used as a pH indicator, to test how much acid or base
(basicity) exists in a solution. You might have even used some to make sure the water in an outdoor swimming pool
is properly treated. In both cases, this pH test measures the amount of hydrogen ions that exists in a given solution.
High concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH, whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH. The
overall concentration of hydrogen ions is inversely related to its pH and can be measured on the **pH scale** ( Figure
2.12 ). Therefore, the more hydrogen ions present, the lower the pH; conversely, the fewer hydrogen ions, the higher
the pH.

The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A change of one unit on the pH scale represents a change in the concentration of
hydrogen ions by a factor of 10, a change in two units represents a change in the concentration of hydrogen ions by
a factor of 100. Thus, small changes in pH represent large changes in the concentrations of hydrogen ions. Pure

water is neutral. It is neither acidic nor basic, and has a pH of 7.0. Anything below 7.0 (ranging from 0.0 to 6.9) is
acidic, and anything above 7.0 (from 7.1 to 14.0) is alkaline. The blood in your veins is slightly alkaline (pH = 7.4).
The environment in your stomach is highly acidic (pH = 1 to 2). Orange juice is mildly acidic (pH = approximately
3.5), whereas baking soda is basic (pH = 9.0).

**FIGURE 2.12** The pH scale measures the amount of hydrogen ions (H + ) in a substance. (credit: modification of work by Edward Stevens)

**Acids** are substances that provide hydrogen ions (H + ) and lower pH, whereas **bases** provide hydroxide ions (OH – )
and raise pH. The stronger the acid, the more readily it donates H + . For example, hydrochloric acid and lemon juice
are very acidic and readily give up H +  when added to water. Conversely, bases are those substances that readily
donate OH – . The OH –  ions combine with H +  to produce water, which raises a substance’s pH. Sodium hydroxide and
many household cleaners are very alkaline and give up OH –  rapidly when placed in water, thereby raising the pH.

Most cells in our bodies operate within a very narrow window of the pH scale, typically ranging only from 7.2 to 7.6.
If the pH of the body is outside of this range, the respiratory system malfunctions, as do other organs in the body.
Cells no longer function properly, and proteins will break down. Deviation outside of the pH range can induce coma
or even cause death.

So how is it that we can ingest or inhale acidic or basic substances and not die? Buffers are the key. **Buffers** readily
absorb excess H +  or OH – , keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the aforementioned narrow range.
Carbon dioxide is part of a prominent buffer system in the human body; it keeps the pH within the proper range. This
buffer system involves carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3 ) and bicarbonate (HCO 3 – ) anion. If too much H +  enters the body,
bicarbonate will combine with the H +  to create carbonic acid and limit the decrease in pH. Likewise, if too much OH –

is introduced into the system, carbonic acid will rapidly dissociate into bicarbonate and H +  ions. The H +  ions can
combine with the OH –  ions, limiting the increase in pH. While carbonic acid is an important product in this reaction,
its presence is fleeting because the carbonic acid is released from the body as carbon dioxide gas each time we
breathe. Without this buffer system, the pH in our bodies would fluctuate too much and we would fail to survive.

**2.3 - Biological Molecules** **39**

### 2.3 Biological Molecules

**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Describe the ways in which carbon is critical to life

- Explain the impact of slight changes in amino acids on organisms

- Describe the four major types of biological molecules

- Understand the functions of the four major types of molecules

The large molecules necessary for life that are built from smaller organic molecules are called biological
**macromolecules** . There are four major classes of biological macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and
nucleic acids), and each is an important component of the cell and performs a wide array of functions. Combined,
these molecules make up the majority of a cell’s dry mass. Biological macromolecules are organic, meaning they
contain carbon and are bound to hydrogen, and may contain oxygen, nitrogen, and additional minor elements.

#### Carbon

It is often said that life is “carbon-based.” This means that carbon atoms, bonded to other carbon atoms or other
elements, form the fundamental components of many, if not most, of the molecules found uniquely in living things.
Other elements play important roles in biological molecules, but carbon certainly qualifies as the “foundation”
element for molecules in living things. It is the bonding properties of carbon atoms that are responsible for its
important role.

#### Carbon Bonding

Carbon contains four electrons in its outer shell. Therefore, it can form four covalent bonds with other atoms or
molecules. The simplest organic carbon molecule is methane (CH 4 ), in which four hydrogen atoms bind to a carbon
atom ( Figure 2.13 ).

**FIGURE 2.13** Carbon can form four covalent bonds to create an organic molecule. The simplest carbon molecule is methane (CH 4 ),
depicted here.

However, structures that are more complex are made using carbon. Any of the hydrogen atoms can be replaced with
another carbon atom covalently bonded to the first carbon atom. In this way, long and branching chains of carbon
compounds can be made ( Figure 2.14 **a** ). The carbon atoms may bond with atoms of other elements, such as
nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus ( Figure 2.14 **b** ). The molecules may also form rings, which themselves can link
with other rings ( Figure 2.14 **c** ). This diversity of molecular forms accounts for the diversity of functions of the
biological macromolecules and is based to a large degree on the ability of carbon to form multiple bonds with itself
and other atoms.

**FIGURE 2.14** These examples show three molecules (found in living organisms) that contain carbon atoms bonded in various ways to other
carbon atoms and the atoms of other elements. (a) This molecule of stearic acid has a long chain of carbon atoms. (b) Glycine, a component
of proteins, contains carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms. (c) Glucose, a sugar, has a ring of carbon atoms and one oxygen atom.

#### Carbohydrates

**Carbohydrates** are macromolecules with which most consumers are somewhat familiar. To lose weight, some
individuals adhere to “low-carb” diets. Athletes, in contrast, often “carb-load” before important competitions to
ensure that they have sufficient energy to compete at a high level. Carbohydrates are, in fact, an essential part of our
diet; grains, fruits, and vegetables are all natural sources of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates provide energy to the
body, particularly through glucose, a simple sugar. Carbohydrates also have other important functions in humans,
animals, and plants.

Carbohydrates can be represented by the formula (CH 2 O) n , where n is the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.
In other words, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules. Carbohydrates are
classified into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.

**Monosaccharides** (mono- = “one”; sacchar- = “sweet”) are simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose. In
monosaccharides, the number of carbon atoms usually ranges from three to six. Most monosaccharide names end
with the suffix -ose. Depending on the number of carbon atoms in the sugar, they may be known as trioses (three
carbon atoms), pentoses (five carbon atoms), and hexoses (six carbon atoms).

Monosaccharides may exist as a linear chain or as ring-shaped molecules; in aqueous solutions, they are usually
found in the ring form.

The chemical formula for glucose is C 6 H 12 O 6 . In most living species, glucose is an important source of energy.
During cellular respiration, energy is released from glucose, and that energy is used to help make adenosine
triphosphate (ATP). Plants synthesize glucose using carbon dioxide and water by the process of photosynthesis, and
the glucose, in turn, is used for the energy requirements of the plant. The excess synthesized glucose is often stored
as starch that is broken down by other organisms that feed on plants.

Galactose (part of lactose, or milk sugar) and fructose (found in fruit) are other common monosaccharides. Although
glucose, galactose, and fructose all have the same chemical formula (C 6 H 12 O 6 ), they differ structurally and
chemically (and are known as isomers) because of differing arrangements of atoms in the carbon chain ( Figure
2.15 ).

**2.3 - Biological Molecules** **41**

**FIGURE 2.15** Glucose, galactose, and fructose are isomeric monosaccharides, meaning that they have the same chemical formula but
slightly different structures.

**Disaccharides** (di- = “two”) form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction (a reaction in which
the removal of a water molecule occurs). During this process, the hydroxyl group (–OH) of one monosaccharide
combines with a hydrogen atom of another monosaccharide, releasing a molecule of water (H 2 O) and forming a
covalent bond between atoms in the two sugar molecules.

Common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose. Lactose is a disaccharide consisting of the monomers
glucose and galactose. It is found naturally in milk. Maltose, or malt sugar, is a disaccharide formed from a
dehydration reaction between two glucose molecules. The most common disaccharide is sucrose, or table sugar,
which is composed of the monomers glucose and fructose.

A long chain of monosaccharides linked by covalent bonds is known as a **polysaccharide** (poly- = “many”). The
chain may be branched or unbranched, and it may contain different types of monosaccharides. Polysaccharides may
be very large molecules. Starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin are examples of polysaccharides.

**Starch** is the stored form of sugars in plants and is made up of amylose and amylopectin (both polymers of glucose).
Plants are able to synthesize glucose, and the excess glucose is stored as starch in different plant parts, including
roots and seeds. The starch that is consumed by animals is broken down into smaller molecules, such as glucose.
The cells can then absorb the glucose.

**Glycogen** is the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates, and is made up of monomers of glucose.
Glycogen is the animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored in liver and muscle
cells. Whenever glucose levels decrease, glycogen is broken down to release glucose.

**Cellulose** is one of the most abundant natural biopolymers. The cell walls of plants are mostly made of cellulose,
which provides structural support to the cell. Wood and paper are mostly cellulosic in nature. Cellulose is made up
of glucose monomers that are linked by bonds between particular carbon atoms in the glucose molecule.

Every other glucose monomer in cellulose is flipped over and packed tightly as extended long chains. This gives
cellulose its rigidity and high tensile strength—which is so important to plant cells. Cellulose passing through our
digestive system is called dietary fiber. While the glucose-glucose bonds in cellulose cannot be broken down by
human digestive enzymes, herbivores such as cows, buffalos, and horses are able to digest grass that is rich in
cellulose and use it as a food source. In these animals, certain species of bacteria reside in the digestive system of
herbivores and secrete the enzyme cellulase. The appendix also contains bacteria that break down cellulose, giving
it an important role in the digestive systems of some ruminants. Cellulases can break down cellulose into glucose
monomers that can be used as an energy source by the animal.

Carbohydrates serve other functions in different animals. Arthropods, such as insects, spiders, and crabs, have an
outer skeleton, called the exoskeleton, which protects their internal body parts. This exoskeleton is made of the

biological macromolecule **chitin** , which is a nitrogenous carbohydrate. It is made of repeating units of a modified
sugar containing nitrogen.

Thus, through differences in molecular structure, carbohydrates are able to serve the very different functions of
energy storage (starch and glycogen) and structural support and protection (cellulose and chitin) ( Figure 2.16 ).

**FIGURE 2.16** Although their structures and functions differ, all polysaccharide carbohydrates are made up of monosaccharides and have
the chemical formula (CH 2 O)n.

#### CAREER CONNECTION

#### Registered Dietitian
Obesity is a worldwide health concern, and many diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, are becoming more
prevalent because of obesity. This is one of the reasons why registered dietitians are increasingly sought after for
advice. Registered dietitians help plan food and nutrition programs for individuals in various settings. They often
work with patients in health-care facilities, designing nutrition plans to prevent and treat diseases. For example,
dietitians may teach a patient with diabetes how to manage blood-sugar levels by eating the correct types and
amounts of carbohydrates. Dietitians may also work in nursing homes, schools, and private practices.

To become a registered dietitian, one needs to earn at least a bachelor’s degree in dietetics, nutrition, food
technology, or a related field. In addition, registered dietitians must complete a supervised internship program and
pass a national exam. Those who pursue careers in dietetics take courses in nutrition, chemistry, biochemistry,
biology, microbiology, and human physiology. Dietitians must become experts in the chemistry and functions of food
(proteins, carbohydrates, and fats).

#### Lipids

Lipids include a diverse group of compounds that are united by a common feature. **Lipids** are hydrophobic (“water-
fearing”), or insoluble in water, because they are nonpolar molecules. This is because they are hydrocarbons that
include only nonpolar carbon-carbon or carbon-hydrogen bonds. Lipids perform many different functions in a cell.
Cells store energy for long-term use in the form of lipids called fats. Lipids also provide insulation from the
environment for plants and animals ( Figure 2.17 ). For example, they help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry
because of their water-repelling nature. Lipids are also the building blocks of many hormones and are an important

constituent of the plasma membrane. Lipids include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids.

**FIGURE 2.17** Hydrophobic lipids in the fur of aquatic mammals, such as this river otter, protect them from the elements. (credit: Ken
Bosma)

A **fat** molecule, such as a triglyceride, consists of two main components—glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol is an
organic compound with three carbon atoms, five hydrogen atoms, and three hydroxyl (–OH) groups. Fatty acids have
a long chain of hydrocarbons to which an acidic carboxyl group is attached, hence the name “fatty acid.” The
number of carbons in the fatty acid may range from 4 to 36; most common are those containing 12–18 carbons. In a
fat molecule, a fatty acid is attached to each of the three oxygen atoms in the –OH groups of the glycerol molecule
with a covalent bond ( Figure 2.18 ).

**FIGURE 2.18** Lipids include fats, such as triglycerides, which are made up of fatty acids and glycerol, phospholipids, and steroids.

During this covalent bond formation, three water molecules are released. The three fatty acids in the fat may be
similar or dissimilar. These fats are also called **triglycerides** because they have three fatty acids. Some fatty acids



-----


**44** **2 - Chemistry of Life**

have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the
palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogaea, the scientific name for peanuts.

Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between
neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is saturated. **Saturated fatty acids** are saturated with
hydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized.

When the hydrocarbon chain contains a double bond, the fatty acid is an **unsaturated fatty acid** .

Most unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and are called **oils** . If there is one double bond in the
molecule, then it is known as a monounsaturated fat (e.g., olive oil), and if there is more than one double bond, then
it is known as a polyunsaturated fat (e.g., canola oil).

Saturated fats tend to get packed tightly and are solid at room temperature. Animal fats with stearic acid and
palmitic acid contained in meat, and the fat with butyric acid contained in butter, are examples of saturated fats.
Mammals store fats in specialized cells called adipocytes, where globules of fat occupy most of the cell. In plants,
fat or oil is stored in seeds and is used as a source of energy during embryonic development.

Unsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant origin and contain unsaturated fatty acids. The double bond causes a
bend or a “kink” that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly, keeping them liquid at room temperature. Olive
oil, corn oil, canola oil, and cod liver oil are examples of unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats help to improve blood
cholesterol levels, whereas saturated fats might contribute to plaque formation in the arteries, which increases the
risk of a heart attack.

In the food industry, oils are artificially hydrogenated to make them semi-solid, leading to less spoilage and
increased shelf life. Simply speaking, hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them. During this
hydrogenation process, double bonds of the cis-conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may be converted to double
bonds in the trans-conformation. This forms a **trans-fat** from a cis-fat. The orientation of the double bonds affects
the chemical properties of the fat ( Figure 2.19 ).

**FIGURE 2.19** During the hydrogenation process, the orientation around the double bonds is changed, making a trans-fat from a cis-fat. This
changes the chemical properties of the molecule.

Margarine, some types of peanut butter, and shortening are examples of artificially hydrogenated trans-fats. Recent
studies have shown that an increase in trans-fats in the human diet may lead to an increase in levels of low-density
lipoprotein (LDL), or “bad” cholesterol, which, in turn, may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries, resulting in
heart disease. Many fast food restaurants have recently eliminated the use of trans-fats, and U.S. food labels are
now required to list their trans-fat content.

Essential fatty acids are fatty acids that are required but not synthesized by the human body. Consequently, they
must be supplemented through the diet. Omega-3 fatty acids fall into this category and are one of only two known
essential fatty acids for humans (the other being omega-6 fatty acids). They are a type of polyunsaturated fat and

**Access for free at openstax.org**



-----


**2.3 - Biological Molecules** **45**

are called omega-3 fatty acids because the third carbon from the end of the fatty acid participates in a double bond.

Salmon, trout, and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are important in brain
function and normal growth and development. They may also prevent heart disease and reduce the risk of cancer.

Like carbohydrates, fats have received a lot of bad publicity. It is true that eating an excess of fried foods and other
“fatty” foods leads to weight gain. However, fats do have important functions. Fats serve as long-term energy
storage. They also provide insulation for the body. Therefore, “healthy” unsaturated fats in moderate amounts
should be consumed on a regular basis.

**Phospholipids** are the major constituent of the plasma membrane. Like fats, they are composed of fatty acid chains
attached to a glycerol or similar backbone. Instead of three fatty acids attached, however, there are two fatty acids
and the third carbon of the glycerol backbone is bound to a phosphate group. The phosphate group is modified by
the addition of an alcohol.

A phospholipid has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. The fatty acid chains are hydrophobic and exclude
themselves from water, whereas the phosphate is hydrophilic and interacts with water.

Cells are surrounded by a membrane, which has a bilayer of phospholipids. The fatty acids of phospholipids face
inside, away from water, whereas the phosphate group can face either the outside environment or the inside of the
cell, which are both aqueous.

**Steroids and Waxes**
Unlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier, **steroids** have a ring structure. Although they do not resemble
other lipids, they are grouped with them because they are also hydrophobic. All steroids have four, linked carbon
rings and several of them, like cholesterol, have a short tail.

Cholesterol is a steroid. Cholesterol is mainly synthesized in the liver and is the precursor of many steroid hormones,
such as testosterone and estradiol. It is also the precursor of vitamins E and K. Cholesterol is the precursor of bile
salts, which help in the breakdown of fats and their subsequent absorption by cells. Although cholesterol is often
spoken of in negative terms, it is necessary for the proper functioning of the body. It is a key component of the
plasma membranes of animal cells.

Waxes are made up of a hydrocarbon chain with an alcohol (–OH) group and a fatty acid. Examples of animal waxes
include beeswax and lanolin. Plants also have waxes, such as the coating on their leaves, that helps prevent them
from drying out.

#### Proteins

**Proteins** are one of the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse range of
functions of all macromolecules. Proteins may be structural, regulatory, contractile, or protective; they may serve in
transport, storage, or membranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes. Each cell in a living system may contain
thousands of different proteins, each with a unique function. Their structures, like their functions, vary greatly. They
are all, however, polymers of amino acids, arranged in a linear sequence.

The functions of proteins are very diverse because there are 20 different chemically distinct amino acids that form
long chains, and the amino acids can be in any order. For example, proteins can function as enzymes or hormones.
**Enzymes** , which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually
proteins. Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) upon which it acts. Enzymes
can function to break molecular bonds, to rearrange bonds, or to form new bonds. An example of an enzyme is
salivary amylase, which breaks down amylose, a component of starch.

**Hormones** are chemical signaling molecules, usually proteins or steroids, secreted by an endocrine gland or group
of endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development,



-----


**46** **2 - Chemistry of Life**

metabolism, and reproduction. For example, insulin is a protein hormone that maintains blood glucose levels.

Proteins have different shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are globular in shape whereas others are
fibrous in nature. For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is a fibrous protein.
Protein shape is critical to its function. Changes in temperature, pH, and exposure to chemicals may lead to
permanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to a loss of function or **denaturation** (to be discussed in
more detail later). All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same 20 kinds of amino acids.

**Amino acids** are the monomers that make up proteins. Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure, which
consists of a central carbon atom bonded to an amino group (–NH 2 ), a carboxyl group (–COOH), and a hydrogen
atom. Every amino acid also has another variable atom or group of atoms bonded to the central carbon atom known
as the R group. The R group is the only difference in structure between the 20 amino acids; otherwise, the amino
acids are identical ( Figure 2.20 ).

**FIGURE 2.20** Amino acids are made up of a central carbon bonded to an amino group (–NH 2 ), a carboxyl group (–COOH), and a hydrogen
atom. The central carbon’s fourth bond varies among the different amino acids, as seen in these examples of alanine, valine, lysine, and
aspartic acid.

The chemical nature of the R group determines the chemical nature of the amino acid within its protein (that is,
whether it is acidic, basic, polar, or nonpolar).

The sequence and number of amino acids ultimately determine a protein’s shape, size, and function. Each amino
acid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond, known as a peptide bond, which is formed by a
dehydration reaction. The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of a second amino acid combine,
releasing a water molecule. The resulting bond is the peptide bond.

The products formed by such a linkage are called polypeptides. While the terms polypeptide and protein are

**Access for free at openstax.org**



-----


**2.3 - Biological Molecules** **47**

sometimes used interchangeably, a **polypeptide** is technically a polymer of amino acids, whereas the term protein is
used for a polypeptide or polypeptides that have combined together, have a distinct shape, and have a unique
function.

#### EVOLUTION CONNECTION

#### The Evolutionary Significance of Cytochrome c
Cytochrome c is an important component of the molecular machinery that harvests energy from glucose. Because
this protein’s role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has changed very little over millions of years. Protein
sequencing has shown that there is a considerable amount of sequence similarity among cytochrome c molecules of
different species; evolutionary relationships can be assessed by measuring the similarities or differences among
various species’ protein sequences.

For example, scientists have determined that human cytochrome c contains 104 amino acids. For each cytochrome
c molecule that has been sequenced to date from different organisms, 37 of these amino acids appear in the same
position in each cytochrome c. This indicates that all of these organisms are descended from a common ancestor.
On comparing the human and chimpanzee protein sequences, no sequence difference was found. When human and
rhesus monkey sequences were compared, a single difference was found in one amino acid. In contrast, human-to-
yeast comparisons show a difference in 44 amino acids, suggesting that humans and chimpanzees have a more
recent common ancestor than humans and the rhesus monkey, or humans and yeast.

**Protein Structure**
As discussed earlier, the shape of a protein is critical to its function. To understand how the protein gets its final
shape or conformation, we need to understand the four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and
quaternary ( Figure 2.21 ).

The unique sequence and number of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure. The unique
sequence for every protein is ultimately determined by the gene that encodes the protein. Any change in the gene
sequence may lead to a different amino acid being added to the polypeptide chain, causing a change in protein
structure and function. William Warrick Cardozo showed that sickle-cell anemia is caused by a change in protein
strucure as a result of gene encoding, meaning that it is an inherited disorder. In sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin
β chain has a single amino acid substitution, causing a change in both the structure and function of the protein.
What is most remarkable to consider is that a hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two beta
chains that each consist of about 150 amino acids. The molecule, therefore, has about 600 amino acids. The
structural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell molecule—that dramatically
decreases life expectancy in the affected individuals—is a single amino acid of the 600.

Because of this change of one amino acid in the chain, the normally biconcave, or disc-shaped, red blood cells
assume a crescent or “sickle” shape, which clogs arteries. This can lead to a myriad of serious health problems,
such as breathlessness, dizziness, headaches, and abdominal pain for those who have this disease.

Folding patterns resulting from interactions between the non-R group portions of amino acids give rise to the
secondary structure of the protein. The most common are the alpha (α)-helix and beta (β)-pleated sheet structures.
Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds. In the alpha helix, the bonds form between every fourth
amino acid and cause a twist in the amino acid chain.

In the β-pleated sheet, the “pleats” are formed by hydrogen bonding between atoms on the backbone of the
polypeptide chain. The R groups are attached to the carbons, and extend above and below the folds of the pleat. The
pleated segments align parallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds form between the same pairs of atoms on each
of the aligned amino acids. The α-helix and β-pleated sheet structures are found in many globular and fibrous
proteins.

The unique three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is known as its tertiary structure. This structure is caused
by chemical interactions between various amino acids and regions of the polypeptide. Primarily, the interactions
among R groups create the complex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein. There may be ionic bonds



-----


**48** **2 - Chemistry of Life**

formed between R groups on different amino acids, or hydrogen bonding beyond that involved in the secondary
structure. When protein folding takes place, the hydrophobic R groups of nonpolar amino acids lay in the interior of
the protein, whereas the hydrophilic R groups lay on the outside. The former types of interactions are also known as
hydrophobic interactions.

In nature, some proteins are formed from several polypeptides, also known as subunits, and the interaction of these
subunits forms the quaternary structure. Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall
structure. For example, hemoglobin is a combination of four polypeptide subunits.

**FIGURE 2.21** The four levels of protein structure can be observed in these illustrations. (credit: modification of work by National Human
Genome Research Institute)

Each protein has its own unique sequence and shape held together by chemical interactions. If the protein is subject
to changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape in what
is known as denaturation as discussed earlier. Denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure is
preserved if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function. Sometimes denaturation
is irreversible, leading to a loss of function. One example of protein denaturation can be seen when an egg is fried or
boiled. The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan, changing from a clear
substance to an opaque white substance. Not all proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria
that survive in hot springs have proteins that are adapted to function at those temperatures.

**2.3 - Biological Molecules** **49**

#### Nucleic Acids

Nucleic acids are key macromolecules in the continuity of life. They carry the genetic blueprint of a cell and carry
instructions for the functioning of the cell.

The two main types of **nucleic acids** are **deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)** and **ribonucleic acid (RNA)** . DNA is the
genetic material found in all living organisms, ranging from single-celled bacteria to multicellular mammals.

The other type of nucleic acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. The DNA molecules never leave the
nucleus, but instead use an RNA intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell. Other types of RNA are also
involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.

DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as **nucleotides** . The nucleotides combine with each other to form a
polynucleotide, DNA or RNA. Each nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five-
carbon) sugar, and a phosphate group ( Figure 2.22 ). Each nitrogenous base in a nucleotide is attached to a sugar
molecule, which is attached to a phosphate group.

**FIGURE 2.22** A nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group.

#### DNA Double-Helical Structure

DNA has a double-helical structure ( Figure 2.23 ). It is composed of two strands, or polymers, of nucleotides. The
strands are formed with bonds between phosphate and sugar groups of adjacent nucleotides. The strands are
bonded to each other at their bases with hydrogen bonds, and the strands coil about each other along their length,
hence the “double helix” description, which means a double spiral.

**FIGURE 2.23** The double-helix model shows DNA as two parallel strands of intertwining molecules. (credit: Jerome Walker, Dennis Myts)

The alternating sugar and phosphate groups lie on the outside of each strand, forming the backbone of the DNA. The
nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior, like the steps of a staircase, and these bases pair; the pairs are bound

to each other by hydrogen bonds. The bases pair in such a way that the distance between the backbones of the two
strands is the same all along the molecule.

remain stable, although increased energy is added to
the system. Water’s cohesive forces allow for the
property of surface tension. All of these unique
properties of water are important in the chemistry of
living organisms.

Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. It
is made up of atoms of different elements. All of the 92
elements that occur naturally have unique qualities
that allow them to combine in various ways to create
compounds or molecules. Atoms, which consist of
protons, neutrons, and electrons, are the smallest units
of an element that retain all of the properties of that
element. Electrons can be donated or shared between
atoms to create bonds, including ionic, covalent, and
hydrogen bonds, as well as van der Waals interactions.

#### 2.2 Water

The pH of a solution is a measure of the concentration
of hydrogen ions in the solution. A solution with a high
number of hydrogen ions is acidic and has a low pH
value. A solution with a high number of hydroxide ions
is basic and has a high pH value. The pH scale ranges
from 0 to 14, with a pH of 7 being neutral. Buffers are
solutions that moderate pH changes when an acid or
base is added to the buffer system. Buffers are
important in biological systems because of their ability
to maintain constant pH conditions.

#### 2.3 Biological Molecules

Living things are carbon-based because carbon plays
such a prominent role in the chemistry of living things.
The four covalent bonding positions of the carbon atom
can give rise to a wide diversity of compounds with
many functions, accounting for the importance of

Water has many properties that are critical to
maintaining life. It is polar, allowing for the formation of
hydrogen bonds, which allow ions and other polar
molecules to dissolve in water. Therefore, water is an
excellent solvent. The hydrogen bonds between water
molecules give water the ability to hold heat better
than many other substances. As the temperature rises,
the hydrogen bonds between water continually break
and reform, allowing for the overall temperature to

carbon in living things. Carbohydrates are a group of
macromolecules that are a vital energy source for the
cell, provide structural support to many organisms, and
can be found on the surface of the cell as receptors or
for cell recognition. Carbohydrates are classified as
monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides,
depending on the number of monomers in the
molecule.

perform a diverse range of functions for the cell. They
help in metabolism by providing structural support and
by acting as enzymes, carriers or as hormones. The
building blocks of proteins are amino acids. Proteins
are organized at four levels: primary, secondary,
tertiary, and quaternary. Protein shape and function are
intricately linked; any change in shape caused by
changes in temperature, pH, or chemical exposure may
lead to protein denaturation and a loss of function.

Lipids are a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar
and hydrophobic in nature. Major types include fats
and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats and
oils are a stored form of energy and can include
triglycerides. Fats and oils are usually made up of fatty
acids and glycerol.

Nucleic acids are molecules made up of repeating units
of nucleotides that direct cellular activities such as cell
division and protein synthesis. Each nucleotide is made
up of a pentose sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a
phosphate group. There are two types of nucleic acids:
DNA and RNA.

Proteins are a class of macromolecules that can

**INTRODUCTION**

Close your eyes and picture a brick wall. What is the basic building block of that

wall? It is a single brick, of course. Like a brick wall, your body is composed of basic building
blocks, and the building blocks of your body are cells.

Your body has many kinds of cells, each specialized for a specific purpose. Just as a home is made
from a variety of building materials, the human body is constructed from many cell types. For
example, epithelial cells protect the surface of the body and cover the organs and body cavities
within. Bone cells help to support and protect the body. Cells of the immune system fight invading
bacteria. Additionally, red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. Each of these cell types
plays a vital role during the growth, development, and day-to-day maintenance of the body. In
spite of their enormous variety, however, all cells share certain fundamental characteristics.

### 3.1 How Cells Are Studied

**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Describe the roles of cells in organisms

- Compare and contrast light microscopy and electron microscopy

- Summarize the cell theory

A cell is the smallest unit of a living thing. A living thing, like you, is called an organism. Thus, cells
are the basic building blocks of all organisms.



-----


**56** **3 - Cell Structure and Function**

In multicellular organisms, several cells of one particular kind interconnect with each other and
perform shared functions to form tissues (for example, muscle tissue, connective tissue, and
nervous tissue), several tissues combine to form an organ (for example, stomach, heart, or brain),
and several organs make up an organ system (such as the digestive system, circulatory system, or
nervous system). Several systems functioning together form an organism (such as an elephant, for
example).

There are many types of cells, and all are grouped into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic
and eukaryotic. Animal cells, plant cells, fungal cells, and protist cells are classified as eukaryotic,
whereas bacteria and archaea cells are classified as prokaryotic. Before discussing the criteria for
determining whether a cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic, let us first examine how biologists study
cells.

#### Microscopy

Cells vary in size. With few exceptions, individual cells are too small to be seen with the naked eye,
so scientists use microscopes to study them. A **microscope** is an instrument that magnifies an
object. Most images of cells are taken with a microscope and are called micrographs.

**Light Microscopes**
To give you a sense of the size of a cell, a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a
meter or eight micrometers (abbreviated as µm) in diameter; the head of a pin is about two
thousandths of a meter (millimeters, or mm) in diameter. That means that approximately 250 red
blood cells could fit on the head of a pin.

The optics of the lenses of a light microscope changes the orientation of the image. A specimen
that is right-side up and facing right on the microscope slide will appear upside-down and facing
left when viewed through a microscope, and vice versa. Similarly, if the slide is moved left while
looking through the microscope, it will appear to move right, and if moved down, it will seem to
move up. This occurs because microscopes use two sets of lenses to magnify the image. Due to
the manner in which light travels through the lenses, this system of lenses produces an inverted
image (binoculars and a dissecting microscope work in a similar manner, but include an additional
magnification system that makes the final image appear to be upright).

Most student microscopes are classified as light microscopes ( Figure 3.2 **a** ). Visible light both
passes through and is bent by the lens system to enable the user to see the specimen. Light
microscopes are advantageous for viewing living organisms, but since individual cells are generally
transparent, their components are not distinguishable unless they are colored with special stains.
Staining, however, usually kills the cells.

Light microscopes commonly used in the undergraduate college laboratory magnify up to
approximately 400 times. Two parameters that are important in microscopy are magnification and
resolving power. Magnification is the degree of enlargement of an object. Resolving power is the
ability of a microscope to allow the eye to distinguish two adjacent structures as separate; the
higher the resolution, the closer those two objects can be, and the better the clarity and detail of
the image. When oil immersion lenses are used, magnification is usually increased to 1,000 times
for the study of smaller cells, like most prokaryotic cells. Because light entering a specimen from
below is focused onto the eye of an observer, the specimen can be viewed using light microscopy.
For this reason, for light to pass through a specimen, the sample must be thin or translucent.

A second type of microscope used in laboratories is the dissecting microscope ( Figure 3.2 **b** ).
These microscopes have a lower magnification (20 to 80 times the object size) than light

**3.1 - How Cells Are Studied** **57**

microscopes and can provide a three-dimensional view of the specimen. Thick objects can be examined with many
components in focus at the same time. These microscopes are designed to give a magnified and clear view of tissue
structure as well as the anatomy of the whole organism. Like light microscopes, most modern dissecting
microscopes are also binocular, meaning that they have two separate lens systems, one for each eye. The lens
systems are separated by a certain distance, and therefore provide a sense of depth in the view of their subject to
make manipulations by hand easier. Dissecting microscopes also have optics that correct the image so that it
appears as if being seen by the naked eye and not as an inverted image. The light illuminating a sample under a
dissecting microscope typically comes from above the sample, but may also be directed from below.

**FIGURE 3.2** (a) Most light microscopes used in a college biology lab can magnify cells up to approximately 400 times. (b) Dissecting
microscopes have a lower magnification than light microscopes and are used to examine larger objects, such as tissues.

**Electron Microscopes**
In contrast to light microscopes, electron microscopes use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light. Not only
does this allow for higher magnification and, thus, more detail ( Figure 3.3 ), it also provides higher resolving power.
Preparation of a specimen for viewing under an electron microscope will kill it; therefore, live cells cannot be viewed
using this type of microscopy. In addition, the electron beam moves best in a vacuum, making it impossible to view
living materials.

In a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cell’s surface, rendering the
details of cell surface characteristics by reflection. Cells and other structures are usually coated with a metal like
gold. In a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam is transmitted through the cell and provides details
of a cell’s internal structures. As you might imagine, electron microscopes are significantly more bulky and
expensive than are light microscopes.

#### CAREER CONNECTION

#### Cytotechnologist
Have you ever heard of a medical test called a Pap smear ( Figure 3.4 )? In this test, a doctor takes a small sample of
cells from the uterine cervix of a patient and sends it to a medical lab where a cytotechnologist stains the cells and
examines them for any changes that could indicate cervical cancer or a microbial infection.

Cytotechnologists (cyto- = cell) are professionals who study cells through microscopic examinations and other
laboratory tests. They are trained to determine which cellular changes are within normal limits or are abnormal.
Their focus is not limited to cervical cells; they study cellular specimens that come from all organs. When they notice
abnormalities, they consult a pathologist, who is a medical doctor who can make a clinical diagnosis.

Cytotechnologists play vital roles in saving people’s lives. When abnormalities are discovered early, a patient’s
treatment can begin sooner, which usually increases the chances of successful treatment.

#### Cell Theory

The microscopes we use today are far more complex than those used in the 1600s by Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a
Dutch shopkeeper who had great skill in crafting lenses. Despite the limitations of his now-ancient lenses, van
Leeuwenhoek observed the movements of protists (a type of single-celled organism) and sperm, which he
collectively termed “animalcules.”

In a 1665 publication called Micrographia, experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term “cell” (from the
Latin cella, meaning “small room”) for the box-like structures he observed when viewing cork tissue through a lens.
In the 1670s, van Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and protozoa. Later advances in lenses and microscope
construction enabled other scientists to see different components inside cells.

By the late 1830s, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed
the **unified cell theory** , which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells, that the cell is the
basic unit of life, and that all new cells arise from existing cells. These principles still stand today.

### 3.2 Comparing Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells

**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Name examples of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms

- Compare and contrast prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells

- Describe the relative sizes of different kinds of cells

Cells fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The predominantly single-celled organisms of
the domains Bacteria and Archaea are classified as prokaryotes (pro- = before; -karyon- = nucleus). Animal cells,
plant cells, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes (eu- = true).

#### Components of Prokaryotic Cells

All cells share four common components: 1) a plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the cell’s interior
from its surrounding environment; 2) cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like region within the cell in which other
cellular components are found; 3) DNA, the genetic material of the cell; and 4) ribosomes, particles that synthesize
proteins. However, prokaryotes differ from eukaryotic cells in several ways.

A **prokaryotic cell** is a simple, single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-
bound organelle. We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic DNA is
found in the central part of the cell: a darkened region called the nucleoid ( Figure 3.5 ).



-----


**60** **3 - Cell Structure and Function**

**FIGURE 3.5** This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell.

Unlike Archaea and eukaryotes, bacteria have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, comprised of sugars and amino
acids, and many have a polysaccharide capsule ( Figure 3.5 ). The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps
the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its
environment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion, while most pili are
used to exchange genetic material during a type of reproduction called conjugation.

#### Eukaryotic Cells

In nature, the relationship between form and function is apparent at all levels, including the level of the cell, and this
will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells. The principle “form follows function” is found in many contexts.
For example, birds and fish have streamlined bodies that allow them to move quickly through the medium in which
they live, be it air or water. It means that, in general, one can deduce the function of a structure by looking at its
form, because the two are matched.

A **eukaryotic cell** is a cell that has a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound compartments or sacs,
called **organelles** , which have specialized functions. The word eukaryotic means “true kernel” or “true nucleus,”
alluding to the presence of the membrane-bound nucleus in these cells. The word “organelle” means “little organ,”
and, as already mentioned, organelles have specialized cellular functions, just as the organs of your body have
specialized functions.

#### Cell Size

At 0.1–5.0 µm in diameter, prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which have diameters
ranging from 10–100 µm ( Figure 3.6 ). The small size of prokaryotes allows ions and organic molecules that enter
them to quickly spread to other parts of the cell. Similarly, any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly
move out. However, larger eukaryotic cells have evolved different structural adaptations to enhance cellular
transport. Indeed, the large size of these cells would not be possible without these adaptations. In general, cell size
is limited because volume increases much more quickly than does cell surface area. As a cell becomes larger, it
becomes more and more difficult for the cell to acquire sufficient materials to support the processes inside the cell,
because the relative size of the surface area across which materials must be transported declines.

comparison.

### 3.3 Eukaryotic Cells

**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Describe the structure of eukaryotic plant and animal cells

- State the role of the plasma membrane

- Summarize the functions of the major cell organelles

- Describe the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix

At this point, it should be clear that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than do prokaryotic cells.
Organelles allow for various functions to occur in the cell at the same time. Before discussing the functions of
organelles within a eukaryotic cell, let us first examine two important components of the cell: the plasma membrane
and the cytoplasm.

**3.3 - Eukaryotic Cells** **63**

#### The Plasma Membrane

Like prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells have a **plasma membrane** ( Figure 3.8 ) made up of a phospholipid bilayer with
embedded proteins that separates the internal contents of the cell from its surrounding environment. A
phospholipid is a lipid molecule composed of two fatty acid chains, a glycerol backbone, and a phosphate group.
The plasma membrane regulates the passage of some substances, such as organic molecules, ions, and water,
preventing the passage of some to maintain internal conditions, while actively bringing in or removing others. Other
compounds move passively across the membrane.

**FIGURE 3.8** The plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins. There are other components, such as cholesterol
and carbohydrates, which can be found in the membrane in addition to phospholipids and protein.

The plasma membranes of cells that specialize in absorption are folded into fingerlike projections called microvilli
(singular = microvillus). This folding increases the surface area of the plasma membrane. Such cells are typically
found lining the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients from digested food. This is an excellent example of
form matching the function of a structure.

People with celiac disease have an immune response to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.
The immune response damages microvilli, and thus, afflicted individuals cannot absorb nutrients. This leads to
malnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea. Patients suffering from celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet.

#### The Cytoplasm

The **cytoplasm** comprises the contents of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope (a
structure to be discussed shortly). It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel-like **cytosol** , the cytoskeleton,
and various chemicals ( Figure 3.7 ). Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water, it has a semi-
solid consistency, which comes from the proteins within it. However, proteins are not the only organic molecules
found in the cytoplasm. Glucose and other simple sugars, polysaccharides, amino acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids,
and derivatives of glycerol are found there too. Ions of sodium, potassium, calcium, and many other elements are
also dissolved in the cytoplasm. Many metabolic reactions, including protein synthesis, take place in the cytoplasm.

#### The Cytoskeleton

If you were to remove all the organelles from a cell, would the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm be the only
components left? No. Within the cytoplasm, there would still be ions and organic molecules, plus a network of
protein fibers that helps to maintain the shape of the cell, secures certain organelles in specific positions, allows
cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell, and enables unicellular organisms to move independently.
Collectively, this network of protein fibers is known as the **cytoskeleton** . There are three types of fibers within the
cytoskeleton: microfilaments, also known as actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules ( Figure 3.9 ).



-----


**64** **3 - Cell Structure and Function**

**FIGURE 3.9** Microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules compose a cell’s cytoskeleton.

Microfilaments are the thinnest of the cytoskeletal fibers and function in moving cellular components, for example,
during cell division. They also maintain the structure of microvilli, the extensive folding of the plasma membrane
found in cells dedicated to absorption. These components are also common in muscle cells and are responsible for
muscle cell contraction. Intermediate filaments are of intermediate diameter and have structural functions, such as
maintaining the shape of the cell and anchoring organelles. Keratin, the compound that strengthens hair and nails,
forms one type of intermediate filament. Microtubules are the thickest of the cytoskeletal fibers. These are hollow
tubes that can dissolve and reform quickly. Microtubules guide organelle movement and are the structures that pull
chromosomes to their poles during cell division. They are also the structural components of flagella and cilia. In cilia
and flagella, the microtubules are organized as a circle of nine double microtubules on the outside and two
microtubules in the center.

The centrosome is a region near the nucleus of animal cells that functions as a microtubule-organizing center. It
contains a pair of centrioles, two structures that lie perpendicular to each other. Each centriole is a cylinder of nine
triplets of microtubules.

The centrosome replicates itself before a cell divides, and the centrioles play a role in pulling the duplicated
chromosomes to opposite ends of the dividing cell. However, the exact function of the centrioles in cell division is
not clear, since cells that have the centrioles removed can still divide, and plant cells, which lack centrioles, are
capable of cell division.

**Flagella and Cilia**
**Flagella** (singular = flagellum) are long, hair-like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and are used to
move an entire cell, (for example, sperm, Euglena). When present, the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella.
When **cilia** (singular = cilium) are present, however, they are many in number and extend along the entire surface of
the plasma membrane. They are short, hair-like structures that are used to move entire cells (such as paramecium)
or move substances along the outer surface of the cell (for example, the cilia of cells lining the fallopian tubes that
move the ovum toward the uterus, or cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that move particulate matter toward
the throat that mucus has trapped).

**3.3 - Eukaryotic Cells** **65**

#### The Endomembrane System

The **endomembrane system** (endo = within) is a group of membranes and organelles ( Figure 3.13 ) in eukaryotic
cells that work together to modify, package, and transport lipids and proteins. It includes the nuclear envelope,
lysosomes, and vesicles, the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which we will cover shortly. Although not
technically within the cell, the plasma membrane is included in the endomembrane system because, as you will see,
it interacts with the other endomembranous organelles.

**The Nucleus**
Typically, the nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a cell ( Figure 3.7 ). The **nucleus** (plural = nuclei) houses the
cell’s DNA in the form of chromatin and directs the synthesis of ribosomes and proteins. Let us look at it in more
detail ( Figure 3.10 ).

**FIGURE 3.10** The outermost boundary of the nucleus is the nuclear envelope. Notice that the nuclear envelope consists of two
phospholipid bilayers (membranes)—an outer membrane and an inner membrane—in contrast to the plasma membrane ( Figure 3.8 ), which
consists of only one phospholipid bilayer. (credit: modification of work by NIGMS, NIH)

The **nuclear envelope** is a double-membrane structure that constitutes the outermost portion of the nucleus
( Figure 3.10 ). Both the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are phospholipid bilayers.

The nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions, molecules, and RNA between the
nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.

To understand **chromatin** , it is helpful to first consider chromosomes. A **chromosome** is a structure within the
nucleus that is made up of DNA, the hereditary material, and proteins. This combination of DNA and proteins is
called chromatin. In eukaryotes, chromosomes are linear structures. Every species has a specific number of
chromosomes in the nucleus of its body cells. For example, in humans, the chromosome number is 46, whereas in
fruit flies, the chromosome number is eight.

Chromosomes are only visible and distinguishable from one another when the cell is getting ready to divide. When
the cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle, the chromosomes resemble an unwound, jumbled
bunch of threads.

We already know that the nucleus directs the synthesis of ribosomes, but how does it do this? Some chromosomes
have sections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA. A darkly staining area within the nucleus, called the **nucleolus**
(plural = nucleoli), aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that
are then transported through the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm.

**The Endoplasmic Reticulum**
The **endoplasmic reticulum (ER)** ( Figure 3.13 ) is a series of interconnected membranous tubules that collectively
modify proteins and synthesize lipids. However, these two functions are performed in separate areas of the
endoplasmic reticulum: the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, respectively.

The hollow portion of the ER tubules is called the lumen or cisternal space. The membrane of the ER, which is a
phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins, is continuous with the nuclear envelope.



-----


**66** **3 - Cell Structure and Function**

The **rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)** is so named because the ribosomes attached to its cytoplasmic surface
give it a studded appearance when viewed through an electron microscope.

The ribosomes synthesize proteins while attached to the ER, resulting in transfer of their newly synthesized proteins
into the lumen of the RER where they undergo modifications such as folding or addition of sugars. The RER also
makes phospholipids for cell membranes.

If the phospholipids or modified proteins are not destined to stay in the RER, they will be packaged within vesicles
and transported from the RER by budding from the membrane ( Figure 3.13 ). Since the RER is engaged in modifying
proteins that will be secreted from the cell, it is abundant in cells that secrete proteins, such as the liver.

The **smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER)** is continuous with the RER but has few or no ribosomes on its
cytoplasmic surface (see Figure 3.7 ). The SER’s functions include synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids (including
phospholipids), and steroid hormones; detoxification of medications and poisons; alcohol metabolism; and storage
of calcium ions.

**The Golgi Apparatus**
We have already mentioned that vesicles can bud from the ER, but where do the vesicles go? Before reaching their
final destination, the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles need to be sorted, packaged, and tagged so that
they wind up in the right place. The sorting, tagging, packaging, and distribution of lipids and proteins take place in
the **Golgi apparatus** (also called the Golgi body), a series of flattened membranous sacs ( Figure 3.11 ).

**FIGURE 3.11** The Golgi apparatus in this transmission electron micrograph of a white blood cell is visible as a stack of semicircular
flattened rings in the lower portion of this image. Several vesicles can be seen near the Golgi apparatus. (credit: modification of work by
Louisa Howard; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)

The Golgi apparatus has a receiving face near the endoplasmic reticulum and a releasing face on the side away from
the ER, toward the cell membrane. The transport vesicles that form from the ER travel to the receiving face, fuse
with it, and empty their contents into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. As the proteins and lipids travel through the
Golgi, they undergo further modifications. The most frequent modification is the addition of short chains of sugar
molecules. The newly modified proteins and lipids are then tagged with small molecular groups to enable them to
be routed to their proper destinations.

Finally, the modified and tagged proteins are packaged into vesicles that bud from the opposite face of the Golgi.
While some of these vesicles, transport vesicles, deposit their contents into other parts of the cell where they will be
used, others, secretory vesicles, fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents outside the cell.

The amount of Golgi in different cell types again illustrates that form follows function within cells. Cells that engage
in a great deal of secretory activity (such as cells of the salivary glands that secrete digestive enzymes or cells of the
immune system that secrete antibodies) have an abundant number of Golgi.

In plant cells, the Golgi has an additional role of synthesizing polysaccharides, some of which are incorporated into
the cell wall and some of which are used in other parts of the cell.

**Lysosomes**
In animal cells, the **lysosomes** are the cell’s “garbage disposal.” Digestive enzymes within the lysosomes aid the
breakdown of proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, and even worn-out organelles. In single-celled

eukaryotes, lysosomes are important for digestion of the food they ingest and the recycling of organelles. These
enzymes are active at a much lower pH (more acidic) than those located in the cytoplasm. Many reactions that take
place in the cytoplasm could not occur at a low pH, thus the advantage of compartmentalizing the eukaryotic cell
into organelles is apparent.

Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to destroy disease-causing organisms that might enter the cell. A good
example of this occurs in a group of white blood cells called macrophages, which are part of your body’s immune
system. In a process known as phagocytosis, a section of the plasma membrane of the macrophage invaginates
(folds in) and engulfs a pathogen. The invaginated section, with the pathogen inside, then pinches itself off from the
plasma membrane and becomes a vesicle. The vesicle fuses with a lysosome. The lysosome’s hydrolytic enzymes
then destroy the pathogen ( Figure 3.12 ).

**FIGURE 3.12** A macrophage has phagocytized a potentially pathogenic bacterium into a vesicle, which then fuses with a lysosome within
the cell so that the pathogen can be destroyed. Other organelles are present in the cell, but for simplicity, are not shown.

**Vesicles and Vacuoles**
**Vesicles** and **vacuoles** are membrane-bound sacs that function in storage and transport. Vacuoles are somewhat
larger than vesicles, and the membrane of a vacuole does not fuse with the membranes of other cellular
components. Vesicles can fuse with other membranes within the cell system. Additionally, enzymes within plant
vacuoles can break down macromolecules.

Magnus Manske)

Why does the cis face of the Golgi not face the plasma membrane?

#### Ribosomes

**Ribosomes** are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. When viewed through an electron
microscope, free ribosomes appear as either clusters or single tiny dots floating freely in the cytoplasm. Ribosomes
may be attached to either the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic
reticulum ( Figure 3.7 ). Electron microscopy has shown that ribosomes consist of large and small subunits.
Ribosomes are enzyme complexes that are responsible for protein synthesis.

Because protein synthesis is essential for all cells, ribosomes are found in practically every cell, although they are
smaller in prokaryotic cells. They are particularly abundant in immature red blood cells for the synthesis of
hemoglobin, which functions in the transport of oxygen throughout the body.

#### Mitochondria

**Mitochondria** (singular = mitochondrion) are often called the “powerhouses” or “energy factories” of a cell because
they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell’s main energy-carrying molecule. The
formation of ATP from the breakdown of glucose is known as cellular respiration. Mitochondria are oval-shaped,
double-membrane organelles ( Figure 3.14 ) that have their own ribosomes and DNA. Each membrane is a
phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The inner layer has folds called cristae, which increase the surface
area of the inner membrane. The area surrounded by the folds is called the mitochondrial matrix. The cristae and
the matrix have different roles in cellular respiration.

In keeping with our theme of form following function, it is important to point out that muscle cells have a very high
concentration of mitochondria because muscle cells need a lot of energy to contract.

outer membranes, the cristae, and the mitochondrial matrix. (credit: modification of work by Matthew Britton; scale-bar data from Matt
Russell)

#### Peroxisomes

**Peroxisomes** are small, round organelles enclosed by single membranes. They carry out oxidation reactions that
break down fatty acids and amino acids. They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body. Alcohol is
detoxified by peroxisomes in liver cells. A byproduct of these oxidation reactions is hydrogen peroxide, H 2 O 2 , which
is contained within the peroxisomes to prevent the chemical from causing damage to cellular components outside
of the organelle. Hydrogen peroxide is safely broken down by peroxisomal enzymes into water and oxygen.

#### Animal Cells versus Plant Cells

Despite their fundamental similarities, there are some striking differences between animal and plant cells (see Table
3.1 ). Animal cells have centrioles, centrosomes (discussed under the cytoskeleton), and lysosomes, whereas plant
cells do not. Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts, plasmodesmata, and plastids used for storage, and a large
central vacuole, whereas animal cells do not.

**The Cell Wall**
In Figure 3.7 **b** , the diagram of a plant cell, you see a structure external to the plasma membrane called the cell wall.
The **cell wall** is a rigid covering that protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell. Fungal
and protist cells also have cell walls.

While the chief component of prokaryotic cell walls is peptidoglycan, the major organic molecule in the plant cell
wall is cellulose, a polysaccharide made up of long, straight chains of glucose units. When nutritional information
refers to dietary fiber, it is referring to the cellulose content of food.

**Chloroplasts**
Like mitochondria, chloroplasts also have their own DNA and ribosomes. **Chloroplasts** function in photosynthesis
and can be found in eukaryotic cells such as plants and algae. In photosynthesis, carbon dioxide, water, and light
energy are used to make glucose and oxygen. This is the major difference between plants and animals: Plants
(autotrophs) are able to make their own food, like glucose, whereas animals (heterotrophs) must rely on other
organisms for their organic compounds or food source.

Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have outer and inner membranes, but within the space enclosed by a chloroplast’s
inner membrane is a set of interconnected and stacked, fluid-filled membrane sacs called thylakoids ( Figure 3.15 ).
Each stack of thylakoids is called a granum (plural = grana). The fluid enclosed by the inner membrane and
surrounding the grana is called the stroma.



-----


**70** **3 - Cell Structure and Function**

**FIGURE 3.15** This simplified diagram of a chloroplast shows the outer membrane, inner membrane, thylakoids, grana, and stroma.

The chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which captures the energy of sunlight for
photosynthesis. Like plant cells, photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts. Some bacteria also perform
photosynthesis, but they do not have chloroplasts. Their photosynthetic pigments are located in the thylakoid
membrane within the cell itself.

#### EVOLUTION CONNECTION

#### Endosymbiosis
We have mentioned that both mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA and ribosomes. Have you wondered why?
Strong evidence points to endosymbiosis as the explanation.

Symbiosis is a relationship in which organisms from two separate species live in close association and typically
exhibit specific adaptations to each other. Endosymbiosis (endo-= within) is a relationship in which one organism
lives inside the other. Endosymbiotic relationships abound in nature. Microbes that produce vitamin K live inside the
human gut. This relationship is beneficial for us because we are unable to synthesize vitamin K. It is also beneficial
for the microbes because they are protected from other organisms and are provided a stable habitat and abundant
food by living within the large intestine.

Scientists have long noticed that bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are similar in size and have other similar
features. In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists discovered that mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA and
ribosomes, just as bacteria do. In 1967, Lynn Margulis used microbial evidence in her proposal of endosymbiotic
theory, which indicated that these organelles originated from separate organisms. Although Margulis’s work was
met with resistance, this basic component of this once-revolutionary hypothesis is now widely accepted. Scientists
believe that host cells and bacteria formed a mutually beneficial endosymbiotic relationship when the host cells
ingested aerobic bacteria and cyanobacteria but did not destroy them. Through evolution, these ingested bacteria
became more specialized in their functions, with the aerobic bacteria becoming mitochondria and the
photosynthetic bacteria becoming chloroplasts.

**The Central Vacuole**
Previously, we mentioned vacuoles as essential components of plant cells. If you look at Figure 3.7 , you will see that
plant cells each have a large, central vacuole that occupies most of the cell. The **central vacuole** plays a key role in
regulating the cell’s concentration of water in changing environmental conditions. In plant cells, the liquid inside the
central vacuole provides turgor pressure, which is the outward pressure caused by the fluid inside the cell. Have you
ever noticed that if you forget to water a plant for a few days, it wilts? That is because as the water concentration in
the soil becomes lower than the water concentration in the plant, water moves out of the central vacuoles and
cytoplasm and into the soil. As the central vacuole shrinks, it leaves the cell wall unsupported. This loss of support
to the cell walls of a plant results in the wilted appearance. Additionally, this fluid has a very bitter taste, which
discourages consumption by insects and animals. The central vacuole also functions to store proteins in developing

seed cells.

#### Extracellular Matrix of Animal Cells

Most animal cells release materials into the extracellular space. The primary components of these materials are
glycoproteins and the protein collagen. Collectively, these materials are called the **extracellular matrix** ( Figure
3.16 ). Not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue, but it also allows the cells
within the tissue to communicate with each other.

**FIGURE 3.16** The extracellular matrix consists of a network of substances secreted by cells.

Blood clotting provides an example of the role of the extracellular matrix in cell communication. When the cells
lining a blood vessel are damaged, they display a protein receptor called tissue factor. When tissue factor binds with
another factor in the extracellular matrix, it causes platelets to adhere to the wall of the damaged blood vessel,
stimulates adjacent smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel to contract (thus constricting the blood vessel), and
initiates a series of steps that stimulate the platelets to produce clotting factors.

#### Intercellular Junctions

Cells can also communicate with each other by direct contact, referred to as intercellular junctions. There are some
differences in the ways that plant and animal cells do this. **Plasmodesmata** (singular = plasmodesma) are junctions
between plant cells, whereas animal cell contacts include tight and gap junctions, and desmosomes.

In general, long stretches of the plasma membranes of neighboring plant cells cannot touch one another because
they are separated by the cell walls surrounding each cell. Plasmodesmata are numerous channels that pass
between the cell walls of adjacent plant cells, connecting their cytoplasm and enabling signal molecules and
nutrients to be transported from cell to cell ( Figure 3.17 **a** ).



-----


**72** **3 - Cell Structure and Function**

**FIGURE 3.17** There are four kinds of connections between cells. (a) A plasmodesma is a channel between the cell walls of two adjacent
plant cells. (b) Tight junctions join adjacent animal cells. (c) Desmosomes join two animal cells together. (d) Gap junctions act as channels
between animal cells. (credit b, c, d: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)

A **tight junction** is a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells ( Figure 3.17 **b** ). Proteins hold the cells tightly
against each other. This tight adhesion prevents materials from leaking between the cells. Tight junctions are
typically found in the epithelial tissue that lines internal organs and cavities, and composes most of the skin. For
example, the tight junctions of the epithelial cells lining the urinary bladder prevent urine from leaking into the
extracellular space.

Also found only in animal cells are **desmosomes** , which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells ( Figure
3.17 **c** ). They keep cells together in a sheet-like formation in organs and tissues that stretch, like the skin, heart, and
muscles.

**Gap junctions** in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells
that allow for the transport of ions, nutrients, and other substances that enable cells to communicate ( Figure 3.17 **d** ).
Structurally, however, gap junctions and plasmodesmata differ.

### 3.4 The Cell Membrane

**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Understand the fluid mosaic model of membranes

- Describe the functions of phospholipids, proteins, and carbohydrates in membranes

A cell’s plasma membrane defines the boundary of the cell and determines the nature of its contact with the
environment. Cells exclude some substances, take in others, and excrete still others, all in controlled quantities.
Plasma membranes enclose the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly
in flux. The plasma membrane must be sufficiently flexible to allow certain cells, such as red blood cells and white
blood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are the more obvious functions of a
plasma membrane. In addition, the surface of the plasma membrane carries markers that allow cells to recognize
one another, which is vital as tissues and organs form during early development, and which later plays a role in the
“self” versus “non-self” distinction of the immune response.

The plasma membrane also carries receptors, which are attachment sites for specific substances that interact with
the cell. Each receptor is structured to bind with a specific substance. For example, surface receptors of the
membrane create changes in the interior, such as changes in enzymes of metabolic pathways. These metabolic
pathways might be vital for providing the cell with energy, making specific substances for the cell, or breaking down
cellular waste or toxins for disposal. Receptors on the plasma membrane’s exterior surface interact with hormones
or neurotransmitters, and allow their messages to be transmitted into the cell. Some recognition sites are used by
viruses as attachment points. Although they are highly specific, pathogens like viruses may evolve to exploit
receptors to gain entry to a cell by mimicking the specific substance that the receptor is meant to bind. This
specificity helps to explain why human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or any of the five types of hepatitis viruses
invade only specific cells.

#### Fluid Mosaic Model

In 1972, S. J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson proposed a new model of the plasma membrane that, compared to
earlier understanding, better explained both microscopic observations and the function of the plasma membrane.
This was called the **fluid mosaic model** . The model has evolved somewhat over time, but still best accounts for the

-----


**3.4 - The Cell Membrane** **75**

structure and functions of the plasma membrane as we now understand them. The fluid mosaic model describes
the structure of the plasma membrane as a mosaic of components—including phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins,
and carbohydrates—in which the components are able to flow and change position, while maintaining the basic
integrity of the membrane. Both phospholipid molecules and embedded proteins are able to diffuse rapidly and
laterally in the membrane. The fluidity of the plasma membrane is necessary for the activities of certain enzymes
and transport molecules within the membrane. Plasma membranes range from 5–10 nm thick. As a comparison,
human red blood cells, visible via light microscopy, are approximately 8 µm thick, or approximately 1,000 times
thicker than a plasma membrane. ( Figure 3.18 )

**FIGURE 3.18** The fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane structure describes the plasma membrane as a fluid combination of
phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates.

The plasma membrane is made up primarily of a bilayer of phospholipids with embedded proteins, carbohydrates,
glycolipids, and glycoproteins, and, in animal cells, cholesterol. The amount of cholesterol in animal plasma
membranes regulates the fluidity of the membrane and changes based on the temperature of the cell’s
environment. In other words, cholesterol acts as antifreeze in the cell membrane and is more abundant in animals
that live in cold climates.

The main fabric of the membrane is composed of two layers of phospholipid molecules, and the polar ends of these
molecules (which look like a collection of balls in an artist’s rendition of the model) ( Figure 3.18 ) are in contact with
aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell. Thus, both surfaces of the plasma membrane are hydrophilic. In
contrast, the interior of the membrane, between its two surfaces, is a hydrophobic or nonpolar region because of the
fatty acid tails. This region has no attraction for water or other polar molecules.

Proteins make up the second major chemical component of plasma membranes. Integral proteins are embedded in
the plasma membrane and may span all or part of the membrane. Integral proteins may serve as channels or pumps
to move materials into or out of the cell. Peripheral proteins are found on the exterior or interior surfaces of
membranes, attached either to integral proteins or to phospholipid molecules. Both integral and peripheral proteins
may serve as enzymes, as structural attachments for the fibers of the cytoskeleton, or as part of the cell’s
recognition sites.

Carbohydrates are the third major component of plasma membranes. They are always found on the exterior surface
of cells and are bound either to proteins (forming glycoproteins) or to lipids (forming glycolipids). These
carbohydrate chains may consist of 2–60 monosaccharide units and may be either straight or branched. Along with
peripheral proteins, carbohydrates form specialized sites on the cell surface that allow cells to recognize each other.

#### EVOLUTION CONNECTION

#### How Viruses Infect Specific Organs
Specific glycoprotein molecules exposed on the surface of the cell membranes of host cells are exploited by many
viruses to infect specific organs. For example, HIV is able to penetrate the plasma membranes of specific kinds of



-----

white blood cells called T-helper cells and monocytes, as well as some cells of the central nervous system. The
hepatitis virus attacks only liver cells.

These viruses are able to invade these cells, because the cells have binding sites on their surfaces that the viruses
have exploited with equally specific glycoproteins in their coats. ( Figure 3.19 ). The cell is tricked by the mimicry of
the virus coat molecules, and the virus is able to enter the cell. Other recognition sites on the virus’s surface interact
with the human immune system, prompting the body to produce antibodies. Antibodies are made in response to the
antigens (or proteins associated with invasive pathogens). These same sites serve as places for antibodies to attach,
and either destroy or inhibit the activity of the virus. Unfortunately, these sites on HIV are encoded by genes that
change quickly, making the production of an effective vaccine against the virus very difficult. The virus population
within an infected individual quickly evolves through mutation into different populations, or variants, distinguished
by differences in these recognition sites. This rapid change of viral surface markers decreases the effectiveness of
the person’s immune system in attacking the virus, because the antibodies will not recognize the new variations of
the surface patterns.

### 3.5 Passive Transport

**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Explain why and how passive transport occurs

- Understand the processes of osmosis and diffusion

- Define tonicity and describe its relevance to passive transport

Plasma membranes must allow certain substances to enter and leave a cell, while preventing harmful material from
entering and essential material from leaving. In other words, plasma membranes are **selectively permeable**
(semipermeable)—they allow some substances through but not others. If they were to lose this selectivity, the cell
would no longer be able to sustain itself, and it would be destroyed. Some cells require larger amounts of specific
substances than do other cells; they must have a way of obtaining these materials from the extracellular fluids. This

**Access for free at openstax.org**

**3.5 - Passive Transport** **77**

may happen passively, as certain materials move back and forth, or the cell may have special mechanisms that
ensure transport. Most cells expend most of their energy, in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to create and
maintain an uneven distribution of ions on the opposite sides of their membranes. The structure of the plasma
membrane contributes to these functions, but it also presents some problems.

The most direct forms of membrane transport are passive. **Passive transport** is a naturally occurring phenomenon
and does not require the cell to expend energy to accomplish the movement. In passive transport, substances move
from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration in a process called diffusion. A physical space
in which there is a different concentration of a single substance is said to have a **concentration gradient** .

#### Selective Permeability

Plasma membranes are asymmetric, meaning that despite the mirror image formed by the phospholipids, the
interior of the membrane is not identical to the exterior of the membrane. Integral proteins that act as channels or
pumps work in one direction. Carbohydrates, attached to lipids or proteins, are also found on the exterior surface of
the plasma membrane. These carbohydrate complexes help the cell bind substances that the cell needs in the
extracellular fluid. This adds considerably to the selective nature of plasma membranes.

Recall that plasma membranes have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. This characteristic helps the movement
of certain materials through the membrane and hinders the movement of others. Lipid-soluble material can easily
slip through the hydrophobic lipid core of the membrane. Substances such as the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K
readily pass through the plasma membranes in the digestive tract and other tissues. Fat-soluble drugs also gain
easy entry into cells and are readily transported into the body’s tissues and organs. Molecules of oxygen and carbon
dioxide have no charge and pass through by simple diffusion.

Polar substances present problems for the membrane. While some polar molecules connect easily with the outside
of a cell, they cannot readily pass through the lipid core of the plasma membrane. Additionally, whereas small ions
could easily slip through the spaces in the mosaic of the membrane, their charge prevents them from doing so. Ions
such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride must have a special means of penetrating plasma membranes.
Simple sugars and amino acids also need help with transport across plasma membranes.

#### Diffusion

**Diffusion** is a passive process of transport. A single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to
an area of low concentration until the concentration is equal across the space. You are familiar with diffusion of
substances through the air. For example, think about someone opening a bottle of perfume in a room filled with
people. The perfume is at its highest concentration in the bottle and is at its lowest at the edges of the room. The
perfume vapor will diffuse, or spread away, from the bottle, and gradually, more and more people will smell the
perfume as it spreads. Materials move within the cell’s cytosol by diffusion, and certain materials move through the
plasma membrane by diffusion ( Figure 3.20 ). Diffusion expends no energy. Rather the different concentrations of
materials in different areas are a form of potential energy, and diffusion is the dissipation of that potential energy as
materials move down their concentration gradients, from high to low.

**FIGURE 3.20** Diffusion through a permeable membrane follows the concentration gradient of a substance, moving the substance from an
area of high concentration to one of low concentration. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villarreal)



-----


**78** **3 - Cell Structure and Function**

Each separate substance in a medium, such as the extracellular fluid, has its own concentration gradient,
independent of the concentration gradients of other materials. Additionally, each substance will diffuse according to
that gradient.

Several factors affect the rate of diffusion.

- Extent of the concentration gradient: The greater the difference in concentration, the more rapid the diffusion.
The closer the distribution of the material gets to equilibrium, the slower the rate of diffusion becomes.

- Mass of the molecules diffusing: More massive molecules move more slowly, because it is more difficult for
them to move between the molecules of the substance they are moving through; therefore, they diffuse more
slowly.

- Temperature: Higher temperatures increase the energy and therefore the movement of the molecules,
increasing the rate of diffusion.

- Solvent density: As the density of the solvent increases, the rate of diffusion decreases. The molecules slow
down because they have a more difficult time getting through the denser medium.

#### LINK TO LEARNING

For an animation of the diffusion process in action, view [this short video (http://openstax.org/l/passive_trnsprt)](http://openstax.org/l/passive_trnsprt) on
cell membrane transport.

#### Facilitated transport

In **facilitated transport** , also called facilitated diffusion, material moves across the plasma membrane with the
assistance of transmembrane proteins down a concentration gradient (from high to low concentration) without the
expenditure of cellular energy. However, the substances that undergo facilitated transport would otherwise not
diffuse easily or quickly across the plasma membrane. The solution to moving polar substances and other
substances across the plasma membrane rests in the proteins that span its surface. The material being transported
is first attached to protein or glycoprotein receptors on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane. This allows
the material that is needed by the cell to be removed from the extracellular fluid. The substances are then passed to
specific integral proteins that facilitate their passage, because they form channels or pores that allow certain
substances to pass through the membrane. The integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are collectively
referred to as transport proteins, and they function as either channels for the material or carriers.

#### Osmosis

**Osmosis** is the movement of free water molecules through a semipermeable membrane according to the water's
concentration gradient across the membrane, which is inversely proportional to the solutes' concentration. Whereas
diffusion transports material across membranes and within cells, osmosis transports only water across a membrane
and the membrane limits the diffusion of solutes in the water. Osmosis is a special case of diffusion. Water, like
other substances, moves from an area of high concentration of free water molecules to one of low free water
molecule concentration. Imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane, separating the two sides or halves
( Figure 3.21 ). On both sides of the membrane, the water level is the same, but there are different concentrations on
each side of a dissolved substance, or **solute** , that cannot cross the membrane. If the volume of the water is the
same, but the concentrations of solute are different, then there are also different concentrations of water, the
solvent, on either side of the membrane.

**3.5 - Passive Transport** **79**

**FIGURE 3.21** In osmosis, water always moves from an area of higher concentration (of water) to one of lower concentration (of water). In
this system, the solute cannot pass through the selectively permeable membrane.

A principle of diffusion is that the molecules move around and will spread evenly throughout the medium if they can.
However, only the material capable of getting through the membrane will diffuse through it. In this example, the
solute cannot diffuse through the membrane, but the water can. Water has a concentration gradient in this system.
Therefore, water will diffuse down its concentration gradient, crossing the membrane to the side where it is less
concentrated. This diffusion of water through the membrane—osmosis—will continue until the concentration
gradient of water goes to zero. Osmosis proceeds constantly in living systems.

#### LINK TO LEARNING

Watch this [video (http://openstax.org/l/dispersion)](http://openstax.org/l/dispersion) that illustrates diffusion in hot versus cold solutions.

#### Tonicity

**Tonicity** describes the amount of solute in a solution. The measure of the tonicity of a solution, or the total amount
of solutes dissolved in a specific amount of solution, is called its **osmolarity** . Three terms—hypotonic, isotonic, and
hypertonic—are used to relate the osmolarity of a cell to the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid that contains the
cells. In a **hypotonic** solution, such as tap water, the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes than the
fluid inside the cell, and water enters the cell. (In living systems, the point of reference is always the cytoplasm, so
the prefix hypo- means that the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes, or a lower osmolarity, than
the cell cytoplasm.) It also means that the extracellular fluid has a higher concentration of water than does the cell.
In this situation, water will follow its concentration gradient and enter the cell. This may cause an animal cell to
burst, or lyse.

In a **hypertonic** solution (the prefix hyper- refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher concentration of solutes
than the cell’s cytoplasm), the fluid contains less water than the cell does, such as seawater. Because the cell has a
lower concentration of solutes, the water will leave the cell. In effect, the solute is drawing the water out of the cell.
This may cause an animal cell to shrivel, or crenate.

In an **isotonic** solution, the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell. If the concentration of solutes of
the cell matches that of the extracellular fluid, there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell. Blood
cells in hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic solutions take on characteristic appearances ( Figure 3.22 ).

A doctor injects a patient with what the doctor thinks is isotonic saline solution. The patient dies, and autopsy
reveals that many red blood cells have been destroyed. Do you think the solution the doctor injected was really
isotonic?

Some organisms, such as plants, fungi, bacteria, and some protists, have cell walls that surround the plasma
membrane and prevent cell lysis. The plasma membrane can only expand to the limit of the cell wall, so the cell will
not lyse. In fact, the cytoplasm in plants is always slightly hypertonic compared to the cellular environment, and
water will always enter a cell if water is available. This influx of water produces turgor pressure, which stiffens the
cell walls of the plant ( Figure 3.23 ). In nonwoody plants, turgor pressure supports the plant. If the plant cells
become hypertonic, as occurs in drought or if a plant is not watered adequately, water will leave the cell. Plants lose
turgor pressure in this condition and wilt.

### 3.6 Active Transport

**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Understand how electrochemical gradients affect ions

- Describe endocytosis, including phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis

- Understand the process of exocytosis

**Active transport** mechanisms require the use of the cell’s energy, usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP). If a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient, that is, if the concentration of the
substance inside the cell must be greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid, the cell must use energy to
move the substance. Some active transport mechanisms move small-molecular weight material, such as ions,
through the membrane.

**3.6 - Active Transport** **81**

In addition to moving small ions and molecules through the membrane, cells also need to remove and take in larger
molecules and particles. Some cells are even capable of engulfing entire unicellular microorganisms. You might have
correctly hypothesized that the uptake and release of large particles by the cell requires energy. A large particle,
however, cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy supplied by the cell.

#### Electrochemical Gradient

We have discussed simple concentration gradients—differential concentrations of a substance across a space or a
membrane—but in living systems, gradients are more complex. Because cells contain proteins, most of which are
negatively charged, and because ions move into and out of cells, there is an electrical gradient, a difference of
charge, across the plasma membrane. The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect to the
extracellular fluid in which they are bathed; at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (K + )
and lower concentrations of sodium (Na + ) than does the extracellular fluid. Thus, in a living cell, the concentration
gradient and electrical gradient of Na +  promotes diffusion of the ion into the cell, and the electrical gradient of Na +

(a positive ion) tends to drive it inward to the negatively charged interior. The situation is more complex, however, for
other elements such as potassium. The electrical gradient of K +  promotes diffusion of the ion into the cell, but the
concentration gradient of K +  promotes diffusion out of the cell ( Figure 3.24 ). The combined gradient that affects an
ion is called its **electrochemical gradient** , and it is especially important to muscle and nerve cells.

**FIGURE 3.24** Electrochemical gradients arise from the combined effects of concentration gradients and electrical gradients. Na +  ions are at
higher concentration outside the cell, and K +  ions are at higher concentration inside of the cell, and yet the inside of the cell has negative
net charge compared to the other side of the membrane. This is due to the presence of K +  binding proteins and other negatively charged
molecules. The difference in electrical charges attracts the positively charged Na ions toward the inside of the cell, the electrical gradient,
while the K ions tend to flow through K channels toward the outside of the cell due to the concentration difference, the concentration
gradient. (credit: modification of work by “Synaptitude”/Wikimedia Commons)

**Moving Against a Gradient**
To move substances against a concentration or an electrochemical gradient, the cell must use energy. This energy is
harvested from ATP that is generated through cellular metabolism. Active transport mechanisms, collectively called
pumps or carrier proteins, work against electrochemical gradients. With the exception of ions, small substances
constantly pass through plasma membranes. Active transport maintains concentrations of ions and other
substances needed by living cells in the face of these passive changes. Much of a cell’s supply of metabolic energy
may be spent maintaining these processes. Because active transport mechanisms depend on cellular metabolism
for energy, they are sensitive to many metabolic poisons that interfere with the supply of ATP.

Two mechanisms exist for the transport of small-molecular weight material and macromolecules. Primary active
transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane. The primary
active transport system uses ATP to move a substance, such as an ion, into the cell, and often at the same time, a

second substance is moved out of the cell. The sodium-potassium pump, an important pump in animal cells,
expends energy to move potassium ions into the cell and a different number of sodium ions out of the cell ( Figure
3.25 ). The action of this pump results in a concentration and charge difference across the membrane.

**FIGURE 3.25** The sodium-potassium pump move potassium and sodium ions across the plasma membrane. (credit: modification of work
by Mariana Ruiz Villarreal)

Secondary active transport describes the movement of material using the energy of the electrochemical gradient
established by primary active transport. Using the energy of the electrochemical gradient created by the primary
active transport system, other substances such as amino acids and glucose can be brought into the cell through
membrane channels. ATP itself is formed through secondary active transport using a hydrogen ion gradient in the
mitochondrion.

#### Endocytosis

**Endocytosis** is a type of active transport that moves particles, such as large molecules, parts of cells, and even
whole cells, into a cell. There are different variations of endocytosis, but all share a common characteristic: The
plasma membrane of the cell invaginates, forming a pocket around the target particle. The pocket pinches off,
resulting in the particle being contained in a newly created vacuole that is formed from the plasma membrane.

**FIGURE 3.26** Three variations of endocytosis are shown. (a) In one form of endocytosis, phagocytosis, the cell membrane surrounds the
particle and pinches off to form an intracellular vacuole. (b) In another type of endocytosis, pinocytosis, the cell membrane surrounds a
small volume of fluid and pinches off, forming a vesicle. (c) In receptor-mediated endocytosis, uptake of substances by the cell is targeted
to a single type of substance that binds at the receptor on the external cell membrane. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz
Villarreal)

**Phagocytosis** is the process by which large particles, such as cells, are taken in by a cell. For example, when
microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil removes the invader through

**3.6 - Active Transport** **83**

this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then destroyed by the neutrophil ( Figure 3.26 ).

A variation of endocytosis is called **pinocytosis** . This literally means “cell drinking” and was named at a time when
the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this process takes in
solutes that the cell needs from the extracellular fluid ( Figure 3.26 ).

A targeted variation of endocytosis employs binding proteins in the plasma membrane that are specific for certain
substances ( Figure 3.26 ). The particles bind to the proteins and the plasma membrane invaginates, bringing the
substance and the proteins into the cell. If passage across the membrane of the target of **receptor-mediated**
**endocytosis** is ineffective, it will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids
and increase in concentration. Some human diseases are caused by a failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For
example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as “bad” cholesterol) is
removed from the blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial
hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-
threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear the chemical from their blood.

#### Exocytosis

In contrast to these methods of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis. **Exocytosis** is the opposite
of the processes discussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid. A
particle enveloped in membrane fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane. This fusion opens the
membranous envelope to the exterior of the cell, and the particle is expelled into the extracellular space ( Figure
3.27 ).

### Chapter Summary

#### 3.1 How Cells Are Studied

have plasma membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes, a cell
wall, DNA, and lack membrane-bound organelles.
Many also have polysaccharide capsules. Prokaryotic
cells range in diameter from 0.1–5.0 µm.

A cell is the smallest unit of life. Most cells are so small
that they cannot be viewed with the naked eye.
Therefore, scientists must use microscopes to study
cells. Electron microscopes provide higher
magnification, higher resolution, and more detail than
light microscopes. The unified cell theory states that all
organisms are composed of one or more cells, the cell
is the basic unit of life, and new cells arise from
existing cells.

Like a prokaryotic cell, a eukaryotic cell has a plasma
membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes, but a
eukaryotic cell is typically larger than a prokaryotic cell,
has a true nucleus (meaning its DNA is surrounded by a
membrane), and has other membrane-bound
organelles that allow for compartmentalization of
functions. Eukaryotic cells tend to be 10 to 100 times
the size of prokaryotic cells.

**86** **3 - Chapter Summary**

eukaryotic cell is typically larger than a prokaryotic cell,
has a true nucleus (meaning its DNA is surrounded by a
membrane), and has other membrane-bound
organelles that allow for compartmentalization of
functions. The plasma membrane is a phospholipid
bilayer embedded with proteins. The nucleolus within
the nucleus is the site for ribosome assembly.
Ribosomes are found in the cytoplasm or are attached
to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or
endoplasmic reticulum. They perform protein
synthesis. Mitochondria perform cellular respiration
and produce ATP. Peroxisomes break down fatty acids,
amino acids, and some toxins. Vesicles and vacuoles
are storage and transport compartments. In plant cells,
vacuoles also help break down macromolecules.

membrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids,
with their hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with
each other. The landscape of the membrane is studded
with proteins, some of which span the membrane.
Some of these proteins serve to transport materials
into or out of the cell. Carbohydrates are attached to
some of the proteins and lipids on the outward-facing
surface of the membrane. These form complexes that
function to identify the cell to other cells. The fluid
nature of the membrane owes itself to the
configuration of the fatty acid tails, the presence of
cholesterol embedded in the membrane (in animal
cells), and the mosaic nature of the proteins and
protein-carbohydrate complexes, which are not firmly
fixed in place. Plasma membranes enclose the borders
of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are
dynamic and constantly in flux.

#### 3.5 Passive Transport

Animal cells also have a centrosome and lysosomes.
The centrosome has two bodies, the centrioles, with an
unknown role in cell division. Lysosomes are the
digestive organelles of animal cells.

Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a central
vacuole. The plant cell wall, whose primary component
is cellulose, protects the cell, provides structural
support, and gives shape to the cell. Photosynthesis
takes place in chloroplasts. The central vacuole
expands, enlarging the cell without the need to
produce more cytoplasm.

The passive forms of transport, diffusion and osmosis,
move material of small molecular weight. Substances
diffuse from areas of high concentration to areas of low
concentration, and this process continues until the
substance is evenly distributed in a system. In
solutions of more than one substance, each type of
molecule diffuses according to its own concentration
gradient. Many factors can affect the rate of diffusion,
including concentration gradient, the sizes of the
particles that are diffusing, and the temperature of the
system.

The endomembrane system includes the nuclear
envelope, the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus,
lysosomes, vesicles, as well as the plasma membrane.
These cellular components work together to modify,
package, tag, and transport membrane lipids and
proteins.

In living systems, diffusion of substances into and out
of cells is mediated by the plasma membrane. Some
materials diffuse readily through the membrane, but
others are hindered, and their passage is only made
possible by protein channels and carriers. The
chemistry of living things occurs in aqueous solutions,
and balancing the concentrations of those solutions is
an ongoing problem. In living systems, diffusion of
some substances would be slow or difficult without
membrane proteins.

#### 3.6 Active Transport

The cytoskeleton has three different types of protein
elements. Microfilaments provide rigidity and shape to
the cell, and facilitate cellular movements.
Intermediate filaments bear tension and anchor the
nucleus and other organelles in place. Microtubules
help the cell resist compression, serve as tracks for
motor proteins that move vesicles through the cell, and
pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a
dividing cell. They are also the structural elements of
centrioles, flagella, and cilia.

Animal cells communicate through their extracellular
matrices and are connected to each other by tight
junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions. Plant cells
are connected and communicate with each other by
plasmodesmata.

#### 3.4 The Cell Membrane

The modern understanding of the plasma membrane is
referred to as the fluid mosaic model. The plasma

The combined gradient that affects an ion includes its
concentration gradient and its electrical gradient.
Living cells need certain substances in concentrations
greater than they exist in the extracellular space.
Moving substances up their electrochemical gradients
requires energy from the cell. Active transport uses
energy stored in ATP to fuel the transport. Active
transport of small molecular-size material uses integral
proteins in the cell membrane to move the
material—these proteins are analogous to pumps.
Some pumps, which carry out primary active transport,

couple directly with ATP to drive their action. In
secondary transport, energy from primary transport
can be used to move another substance into the cell
and up its concentration gradient.

enclosed by an envelope of plasma membrane.
Vacuoles are broken down by the cell, with the
particles used as food or dispatched in some other
way. Pinocytosis is a similar process on a smaller scale.
The cell expels waste and other particles through the
reverse process, exocytosis. Wastes are moved outside
the cell, pushing a membranous vesicle to the plasma
membrane, allowing the vesicle to fuse with the
membrane and incorporating itself into the membrane
structure, releasing its contents to the exterior of the
cell.

Endocytosis methods require the direct use of ATP to
fuel the transport of large particles such as
macromolecules; parts of cells or whole cells can be
engulfed by other cells in a process called
phagocytosis. In phagocytosis, a portion of the
membrane invaginates and flows around the particle,
eventually pinching off and leaving the particle wholly
