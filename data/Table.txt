Cell Component Function Present in Prokaryotes? Present in Animal Cells? Present in Plant Cells? Plasma membrane Separates cell from external environment; controls passage of organic molecules, ions, water, oxygen, and wastes into and out of the cell Yes Yes Yes Cytoplasm Provides structure to cell; site of many metabolic reactions; medium in which organelles are found Yes Yes Yes Nucleoid Location of DNA Yes No No Nucleus Cell organelle that houses DNA and directs synthesis of ribosomes and proteins No Yes Yes Ribosomes Protein synthesis Yes Yes Yes Mitochondria ATP production/cellular respiration No Yes Yes Peroxisomes Oxidizes and breaks down fatty acids and amino acids, and detoxifies poisons No Yes Yes Vesicles and vacuoles Storage and transport; digestive function in plant cells No Yes Yes Centrosome Unspecified role in cell division in animal cells; organizing center of microtubules in animal cells No Yes No Lysosomes Digestion of macromolecules; recycling of worn-out organelles No Yes No Cell wall Protection, structural support and maintenance of cell shape Yes, primarily peptidoglycan in bacteria but not Archaea No Yes, primarily cellulose Chloroplasts Photosynthesis No No Yes Endoplasmic reticulum Modifies proteins and synthesizes lipids No Yes Yes Golgi apparatus Modifies, sorts, tags, packages, and distributes lipids and proteins No Yes Yes
Cell Component Function Present in Prokaryotes? Present in Animal Cells? Present in Plant Cells? Cytoskeleton Maintains cellâ€™s shape, secures organelles in specific positions, allows cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell, and enables unicellular organisms to move independently Yes Yes Yes Flagella Cellular locomotion Some Some No, except for some plant sperm. Cilia Cellular locomotion, movement of particles along extracellular surface of plasma membrane, and filtration No Some No
